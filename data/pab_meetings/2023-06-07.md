## Main Agenda Items Discussed

### Item 5A: Annexation Application - Hilliard Isle Property

**Applicant:** Medina Capital Group
**Representative:** Jeremy Anderson, Common Oak Engineering (4016 Edgewater Drive, Orlando)
**Location:** Southeast corner of Simpson Road and Hilliard Isle
**Property Description:** Triangular-shaped lot

#### Background and History:
- **2000:** Original property was annexed to City of Kissimmee
- **2008:** Final plat approved with realignment of Hilliard Isle Road
  - Realignment created a new road alignment (shown in yellow on presentation)
  - Southern portion of property was closed off due to realignment
- **2015:** Osceola County approved vacation of right-of-way
  - Initiated by property owner to offset property loss from road realignment
  - Medina Capital Group received the vacated right-of-way and now owns it
- **Present:** Portion of property remains in County jurisdiction (shown in blue on presentation)

#### Current Situation:
- The road reconfiguration left a triangular parcel that became nearly undevelopable
- The property lost significant area to the county for road alignment
- The vacated right-of-way portion was never properly annexed in 2015, leaving it as "dead land"

#### Technical Details:
- Proposed annexation meets all requirements for voluntary annexation under local and Florida State statutes
- Property is contiguous to city limits along northern and southern boundaries
- Development Review Committee reviewed and approved the application

#### Staff Presentation:
- Presenter: Christian, Development Services
- Staff recommended approval of the annexation
- Final outcome would shift city limits to include entire developable site

#### Applicant Statement:
Jeremy Anderson explained that his firm was involved in the original 2015 vacation process and acknowledged they should have completed the annexation at that time. The property has remained in an unusual jurisdictional status since then.

**Decision:**
- **Motion:** Bob made motion to approve
- **Second:** Melissa
- **Vote:** Unanimous approval

### Item 5B: Land Use Plan Amendment - Hilliard Isle Property

**Presenter:** Christian, Development Services
**Related To:** Item 5A (Annexation)

#### Purpose:
This was the second part of a three-part application process required for the annexation. The newly annexed portion requires a land use designation.

#### Details:
- **Current Land Use:** Commercial General (existing portion in red on map)
- **Proposed Land Use:** Commercial General (to be extended to entire site)
- **Rationale:** Maintain consistency across the entire property
- Based on City's Comprehensive Plan designation

#### Review Status:
- Development Review Committee reviewed and approved
- Staff recommended approval with conditions

#### Discussion:
Board members had no questions. Applicant deferred to staff presentation.

**Decision:**
- **Motion:** Bob made motion to approve with conditions
- **Second:** Received
- **Vote:** Unanimous approval

### Item 5C: Zoning Map Amendment - Hilliard Isle Property

**Presenter:** Christian, Development Services
**Related To:** Items 5A and 5B

#### Purpose:
Final part of three-part application process (Annexation, Land Use, Zoning). This establishes zoning and development standards for the site.

#### Details:
- **Current Zoning:** B-2 Neighborhood Commercial (existing portion)
- **Proposed Zoning:** B-2 Neighborhood Commercial (to be extended to entire site)
- **Rationale:** Consistency with existing zoning to allow development of entire site

#### Review Status:
- Development Review Committee reviewed and approved
- Staff recommended approval with conditions

#### Discussion:
No questions from board members or additional comments from applicant. Chair noted they forgot to ask for public comments on Item 5B but offered opportunity for comments at this time. No public comments were received.

## Notable Points

### Historical Context
The meeting addressed a unique situation where a property's jurisdictional status had been unclear since 2015 when a right-of-way vacation occurred. The road realignment in 2008 had created development challenges that were only being fully resolved through this annexation process.

### Process Efficiency
All three related items (5A, 5B, 5C) were processed efficiently with unanimous approval. The staff presentations were thorough, and the applicant's representative acknowledged the work done by city staff.

### Board Efficiency
This was a brief, efficient meeting with no controversial items. The entire meeting lasted only 11 minutes, with the board demonstrating clear understanding of the interconnected nature of the three applications.
