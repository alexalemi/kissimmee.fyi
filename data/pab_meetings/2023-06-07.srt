1
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,280
- Okay, hi everyone. It is 6:01.

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,700
Are we ready to go live here?

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,680
Ready. Okay.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,790
6:01, calling the
meeting to order at 6:01.

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,150
I'm going to ask to stand
for a moment of silence

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,870
and the Pledge of Allegiance, please.

7
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:38,570
- I pledge allegiance to the flag

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,800
of the United States of America

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,110
and to the republic for which it stands.

10
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,008
one nation under God, indivisible,

11
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:49,440
with liberty and justice for al.

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,273
- Thank you.

13
00:00:50,273 --> 00:00:52,830
I'll ask everyone to
please make sure to silence

14
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,860
your electronic devices.

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,270
And item three, approval
of the May 17th planning,

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,103
a motion to approve.

17
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,789
- Approve.
- Meeting, oh, we got already.

18
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:05,567
(indistinct crosstalk)
- You got to do it.

19
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:06,961
- Thank you, a motion
approve, we have a second?

20
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:07,794
- Second.

21
00:01:07,794 --> 00:01:09,870
- We got a second. All
in favor, please say aye.

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,190
- Aye.
- Aye.

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,200
- Opposed, please say no. Hearing none.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,720
Minutes are approved for
old business, nothing there,

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,283
five, 5A.

26
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,230
- Christian with development services,

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,100
the applicant's requesting approval

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,503
for an annexation application.

29
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,870
Subject site is located on
southeast corner of Simpson Road

30
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,253
and Hilliard Isle, it's
this triangular shaped lot.

31
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,690
Before I go into details

32
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,760
let me just give you a brief history

33
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,193
about this site because
it's a bit unusual.

34
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,700
In the year two thousand

35
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,030
subject property was annexed
to the City of Kissimmee

36
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,160
which you can see here, outlined in red.

37
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,160
It was the overall site,
and to the south of this

38
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,150
was Hilliard Isle, which was
originally used as a road

39
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,333
and it was in the Osceola
County's jurisdiction.

40
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,483
Next one, please.

41
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,940
Here's the overall history of the site.

42
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,930
In the year 2008, a
final plat was approved

43
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,980
which included the realignment
of the Hilliard Isle Road

44
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,470
which you can see here in yellow

45
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,640
which intersected the subject property

46
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:40,440
and which in turn closed
off the southern portion

47
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,440
which is labeled in blue,
due to this realignment.

48
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,630
In 2015, the Osceola County
approved the vacation

49
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,880
of right away, which was initiated

50
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,980
by the property owner at the time.

51
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,690
This was done to offset the loss

52
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,160
of the property that was provided

53
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,563
for this realignment
of Hilliard Isle Road.

54
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,953
Next please.

55
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,860
Present data is what we have currently.

56
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,680
We have the subject site
and the proposed annexation.

57
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,063
As you can see, the yellow line
represents the city limits.

58
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,680
So the applicant is
requesting the annexation

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,560
of this portion, which is
in blue, of the property

60
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,393
in order to develop the entire site.

61
00:03:26,827 --> 00:03:29,861
The proposed annexation meets
all the requirements set forth

62
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:33,510
by local and Florida State
statutes for voluntary annexation

63
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,780
as a property is contiguous
to the city limits

64
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,513
along the northern and
southern boundaries.

65
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,280
The Development Review
Committee has reviewed

66
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,110
and approved the application.

67
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,630
And again this is going
to be the final outcome

68
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,500
where we have the the city limits shifted

69
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,220
and the overall site will be developable

70
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,850
which is the final
outcome or what the intent

71
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,010
of the applicant wishes to do,

72
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,840
therefore, Staff recommends approval

73
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,150
of the proposed annexation and I'll be

74
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,340
more than happy to answer
any questions you may have.

75
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,283
- Board members, any questions
or comments for the city?

76
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,000
No? Would the applicant
like to say any words

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,050
regarding this?

78
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,520
Please step to the mic, say your name

79
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,320
and business address for the record.

80
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,380
- Absolutely, good evening.

81
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,660
My name is Jeremy Anderson.

82
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,700
I'm with Common Oak Engineering,

83
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,070
4016 Edgewater Drive, Orlando,

84
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,190
I'm here today on behalf
of Medina Capital Group

85
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,093
who is the applicant as well
as the owner of Hilliard Isle.

86
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,850
I'd like to thank you, thank Staff.

87
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,680
I read through the entire Staff package

88
00:04:43,002 --> 00:04:46,320
and honestly summarized
things things quite well.

89
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,150
I was involved with the
development as a civil engineer

90
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,150
and as also in 2015 I was
involved with the vacation process

91
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,770
where Medina Capital Group received

92
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,970
the vacated right of way.

93
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,003
So they now own that right of way.

94
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,330
As Staff alluded to there,

95
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,590
was showing you the images
there when the county

96
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,850
reconfigured the roadway

97
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,710
of course they reconfigured it to put it

98
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,380
in alignment with another
road across the street.

99
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,440
A significant amount of
the property was, you know

100
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,563
given to the county for that alignment.

101
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,360
And so it basically left that,
if you add in with the fact

102
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,761
that that parcel on the corner
there is a triangular piece.

103
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:38,490
And then you add also that
loss in property associated

104
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,290
with the donation or I guess
it would be a dedication,

105
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,320
it was done by Plat, so it was almost like

106
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,690
not even developable.

107
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,250
So with this request again in 2015,

108
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,990
really we should as
applicant have taken it

109
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,830
to the next step.

110
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,010
I thought we thought maybe
it was just going to happen

111
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,190
naturally or whatever, on
its own, but it didn't,

112
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:07,190
so it's just like left as
like a zoning that is like,

113
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,840
kind of like dead land, right?

114
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,630
So that's kind of a summary of the request

115
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,660
a little bit more and I'm
here to answer any questions

116
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,150
you might have and thank
you for opportunity.

117
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,430
- Board members, any
questions for the applicant?

118
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,320
Comments?
- No.

119
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,963
- If not, do we have any public comments?

120
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,630
No, okay.

121
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,940
Anyone like to make a
motion regarding the motion

122
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,200
to approve five A?

123
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,050
Bob made a motion.

124
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,290
Do we have a second, Melissa.

125
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,330
Second. Any discussion?

126
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,350
All in favor, please say aye.

127
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,553
- Aye.
- Aye.

128
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,460
- All opposed, please
say no. Hearing none.

129
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,750
Motion carries unanimously.

130
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,893
Five B.

131
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,743
- I'm actually in charge
of this one as well.

132
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,110
This one is for a land use plan amendment

133
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,420
and this is part of the annexation request

134
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,130
since that portion is going to be annexed

135
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,070
with the previous
application, it is required

136
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,800
to have a land use proposal.

137
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,710
In this case, the applicant has initiated

138
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,643
the land use plan amendment
which we had before you.

139
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:18,150
And just to give you some idea

140
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,370
of what's going on out there,
what you see here in red

141
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,770
is the existing land use.

142
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,930
This is based on the comprehensive plan

143
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,110
of commercial general,
which allows primarily

144
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,313
commercial uses.

145
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,010
So in order to make this fluent,

146
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,510
the applicant has requested
to carry this over

147
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,780
to the subject site
and for the entire site

148
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,373
to be at this category
which is commercial general.

149
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,130
The land use application has
been reviewed and approved

150
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,140
by the development review committee

151
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,260
and staff is recommending
approval with conditions

152
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,310
for the proposed land use
plan amendment application.

153
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,780
And again, if you have any questions,

154
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,910
please feel free to ask

155
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,700
- Board members any questions,
comments for the city?

156
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,970
No. Would the applicant
like to add anything or

157
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,520
you don't have to if
it's summed up already.

158
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,320
Okay. And if they have any questions,

159
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,812
they'll ask certainly.

160
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:21,300
Board any motion regarding
this agenda item?

161
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,068
- I'll make a motion for
final motion to be approved.

162
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:24,630
- Bob, okay.

163
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,830
- With the conditions?

164
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,891
- With the conditions, any second?

165
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:32,100
We have a second. Any discussion?

166
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,873
All in favor, please say aye.

167
00:08:33,873 --> 00:08:34,706
- Aye.
- Aye

168
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:36,510
- Opposed. Please say no. Hearing none.

169
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,123
Motion carries five C please.

170
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,310
- Five C.

171
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,560
That's also, again it is the three part

172
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,150
actually with this annexation.

173
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,400
You have your annexation, land use,

174
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,500
and finally you have
your zoning map amendment

175
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,350
which is what gives the zoning
and development standards

176
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,313
for the site.

177
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,313
The next Thank you.

178
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,930
Currently the subject side is zoned at B-2

179
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,700
which is neighborhood commercial.

180
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,610
And the applicant has made
the same request similar

181
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,960
to the land use plan amendment
for the zoning map amendment.

182
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,140
They want to keep the B2
neighborhood traditional

183
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,540
in order to develop the site.

184
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,343
So in order to be consistent,

185
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,020
the applicant has made this request.

186
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,690
And again, this zoning
map amendment application

187
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,880
has also been reviewed by the
Development Review Committee

188
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,080
and approved.

189
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,300
So staff recommends
approval with conditions

190
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,010
for this same application.

191
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,540
Again, you have any questions?

192
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,680
Please dial me.

193
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,339
- Board members questions?
Comments for the city?

194
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:38,172
- No.

195
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:39,510
- No, applicant, anything?

196
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,482
Okay, any public comments
which I failed to ask

197
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:44,550
the last time for public comments

198
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,362
and will allow that if-

199
00:09:46,362 --> 00:09:47,220
(chuckles)

200
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,080
Okay, board any motion regarding five C.

201
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,400
Motion approved, Melissa.

202
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,233
- I'll second.

203
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,950
- And we have a second, Bob.

204
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,310
Any discussion? If not, a call to vote.

205
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,597
All in favor, please say aye.

206
00:10:00,597 --> 00:10:01,430
- Aye
- Aye.

207
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,820
- Opposed, please say no.

208
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,250
Hearing none. Motion passes unanimously.

209
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,180
Thank you.

210
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,423
Six public hearings. Anything?

211
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,373
Seven, discussion. Board? City?

212
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,660
- It's just that I
believe we do have items

213
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,400
for the next meeting.

214
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,010
The first planning advisory board meeting.

215
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,180
I believe we do have items.
- The 21st?

216
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,800
No, it's going to be, oh goodness.

217
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,040
I should have this, June 21st, I'm sorry.

218
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,840
I'm skipping over to July already.

219
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,621
(indistinct crosstalk)

220
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:37,263
Yes, June 21st.

221
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:39,450
- I will not be here,
I'll be out of state.

222
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,400
- Okay.
- On that day, so.

223
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,270
- Okay.
- Make a note of that.

224
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,170
- I'll make a note of that.

225
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,160
But yeah, we do have several
items going to June 21st

226
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,110
actually be a conditional
use, I'm just wondering.

227
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,210
It'll be a conditional use and a rezoning.

228
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,043
- Okay.

229
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,360
I have nothing to say at the moment.

230
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,000
Any board members with
any comments or anything?

231
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,980
No?
- I do.

232
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,090
- Bob, go right ahead.

233
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,410
- I make a motion to adjourn.

234
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,451
- We have a motion to
adjourn. Do we have a second?

235
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:08,284
- Second.

236
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:09,960
- The second from Melissa. Any discussion?

237
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,823
- No. All in favor, please say aye.

238
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:13,350
- Aye.
- Aye

239
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,440
- Please say no. We're adjourned.

240
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,793
6:12, thank you.
