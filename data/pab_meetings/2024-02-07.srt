1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,490
- And it's six o'clock.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,510
Welcome, everybody.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,310
Calling the meeting to order.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,560
I'd like everyone to stand please

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,163
for the Pledge of Allegiance
and a moment of silence.

6
00:00:21,798 --> 00:00:23,270
- I pledge allegiance to the flag

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,299
of the United States of America,

8
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:28,145
and to Republic of which it stands,

9
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:30,912
one nation, under God, indivisible,

10
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:33,539
with liberty and justice for all.

11
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:34,539
- Thank you.

12
00:00:37,218 --> 00:00:40,710
I'll also ask everyone to,
and I'll do this myself,

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,443
make sure to silence your devices please.

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,960
Board members too.

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,700
Sometimes we've forgotten.

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,110
Thank you.

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,230
And upfront, if any of the board members

18
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,210
have had any ex-parte communication,

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,310
done any research on
your own, site visits,

20
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,425
anything like that for
any of the agenda items,

21
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:00,410
please make that known

22
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,850
if there's potentially any
sort of conflict of interest

23
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,733
or thing that you need to disclose.

24
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,620
Let's start with the approval

25
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,125
of the December 20th meeting minutes.

26
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,670
Do we have any motions
regarding those minutes?

27
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,465
- I'll make a motion to approve.

28
00:01:16,465 --> 00:01:18,060
- We have a motion to approve from Robert.

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,000
- Second.
- We have a second from Alex.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,631
And all in favor, please say aye.

31
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:24,540
- Aye.
- Aye.

32
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,860
Opposed, please say no.

33
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,960
Hearing none, minutes are approved.

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,450
Brenda, could you just explain to me,

35
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,257
'cause I think it came up also,

36
00:01:32,257 --> 00:01:36,360
the detail of these minutes here

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,490
if that's what we're
gonna see in the future,

38
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,564
just to manage our expectations
of how detailed this was.

39
00:01:42,564 --> 00:01:43,397
- Sure.

40
00:01:43,397 --> 00:01:44,273
If I recall,

41
00:01:44,273 --> 00:01:48,240
I think those minutes included
the Hilliard Isle PUD.

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,950
And also, we do have
Alicia here as an addition.

43
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,770
We're gonna continue to work
with the City Clerk's Office

44
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,490
because I know that
there's some guidelines

45
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,040
of what to include with city minutes.

46
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,210
So it's twofold.

47
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,680
That was a longer meeting.

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,790
We had quite a few public
comments that were there,

49
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,160
but we'll continue to work
with the Clerk's Office

50
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,110
regarding the meeting minutes,

51
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,640
what we need to include in there,

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,009
or paraphrasing, or what have you.

53
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:17,920
- Alicia, this is not a knock.

54
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,753
- Yeah.

55
00:02:18,753 --> 00:02:19,586
- If you did these minutes.

56
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:22,560
I mean, they're incredibly
detailed, and kudos to you.

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,393
I just-

58
00:02:24,888 --> 00:02:26,027
- It's a lot to get down.

59
00:02:26,027 --> 00:02:26,957
- Yeah.

60
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:30,000
Glad I don't have that job, but nice.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,833
All right.

62
00:02:31,907 --> 00:02:34,041
Old business, nothing there.

63
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,210
5A, conditional use with site plan

64
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,050
to establish a chiropractic
office with a live-work unit.

65
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,000
Brenda?
- Yes.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,250
This is a conditional use with site plan.

67
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,850
It's about a .2 acres of land.

68
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,310
It's actually here on the
south side of Vine Street,

69
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,620
so it's a pretty small lot.

70
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,810
This will be, as I remember,

71
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,212
this will be the first live-work unit-

72
00:02:57,212 --> 00:02:58,734
- I'm sorry, I said live
work, live work, sorry-

73
00:02:58,734 --> 00:03:00,180
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

74
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,320
- It's a live-work unit.

75
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,330
And so, what's included in the packet

76
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,790
was a 3,000 square foot building.

77
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,820
The first floor will
have the actual office,

78
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,000
about 1500 square feet
for the chiropractic,

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,303
and on the second floor will
be the residential portion.

80
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:18,960
The difference between a home occupation

81
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,190
and a live-work unit.

82
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,800
Home occupation, the city limits,

83
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,170
the presence, customer presence,

84
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,510
where it's pretty much the computer

85
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,540
and there's not customers
that are coming to the home.

86
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,990
A live-work unit, we are
encouraging that interaction

87
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,240
where the property owner
can reside on the property

88
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,950
and they can have, in
this case, a chiropractic,

89
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,640
have patients and they're
on the first floor,

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,060
but the property owner can
reside on the property.

91
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,550
I know there's certain other
communities in the county,

92
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,100
like your Celebration
or even City of Orlando,

93
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,750
where they have live-work units.

94
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,400
It's internally connected,

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,060
so where you can have office
space for your practice,

96
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,490
but you can actually
reside there too as well.

97
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,823
So this will be the first
of its kind in the city.

98
00:04:05,823 --> 00:04:08,100
The form base code, or
the Vine Street corridor,

99
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,800
there are some incentives that we have.

100
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,880
One being the property street frontage.

101
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,710
In this case, the, how
much of the property width

102
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,660
will consist of the building.

103
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,310
And we have those standards.

104
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,350
In this case, it'll be 52%,

105
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,420
but if you have a live-work unit,

106
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,263
we don't require that
minimum frontage to be met.

107
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,180
In that case,

108
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,330
because it is being proposed
as a live-work unit,

109
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,360
it can't readily be converted to separate

110
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,210
where you have a separate
business on the first floor

111
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,040
and then renting out the second floor.

112
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,040
And part of the conditions
of approval that we have

113
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,379
is that cannot occur, and that if there-

114
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:51,912
- I'm sorry, it cannot what?

115
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:53,920
- It can't occur to where
the residential unit

116
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,570
is rented out separately to
someone that does, number one,

117
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,970
doesn't have their business
on that first floor.

118
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,010
It cannot happen

119
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,707
because we're already
waiving the requirement

120
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,704
for the frontage requirement.

121
00:05:09,704 --> 00:05:12,210
And in addition to that, any other use

122
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,580
would require either additional parking

123
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,780
or other site improvements

124
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,270
if it was converted to something else.

125
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,280
So that's part of the
conditions of approval,

126
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,350
that it has to remain a live-work unit,

127
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,650
in addition to providing a fence to buffer

128
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,430
the existing Orange Gardens
community and residential

129
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,333
to the south.

130
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,360
Bicycle lockers were also introduced.

131
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,540
That's also a city-wide
incentive to reduce parking.

132
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,040
We encourage bicycle lockers

133
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,500
or other types of modes of transportation.

134
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,620
So the city provides an incentive
for every bicycle locker.

135
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,940
The parking requirement

136
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,193
can be reduced by two parking spaces.

137
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:50,910
With that in mind, staff
is recommending approval,

138
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,010
subject to the conditions listed,

139
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,010
and I'm here and the applicant's
representative is also here

140
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,070
to answer any questions that you may have.

141
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,903
- Okay.

142
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:00,540
Upfront, does the board have any questions

143
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,997
for Brenda and the city?

144
00:06:01,997 --> 00:06:05,490
Before I ask the applicant if, sir,

145
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,983
if you'd like to step to the
microphone and state your name

146
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:10,823
and your business address for the record?

147
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,530
- Yes, my name's Lee
Hale, and business address

148
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,930
is 111 South Maitland
Avenue, Maitland, Florida.

149
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,100
- Just if you have anything
you wanna add or say, okay.

150
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,250
You don't have to.

151
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,560
- I'm just here to answer questions,

152
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,756
make sure everyone's on the same page.

153
00:06:26,756 --> 00:06:27,589
- Okay.

154
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:29,430
Board members, any
questions for the applicant?

155
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,738
- No.

156
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:33,030
- If not, you can be seated.

157
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,082
Thank you.

158
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:35,610
Do we have any public comments?

159
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,280
Any comments from the public
regarding this agenda item?

160
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,140
Any public comments?

161
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,973
No?

162
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:42,450
Okay.

163
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,609
Board, do we have any motions
regarding this agenda item?

164
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:48,191
- I'll make a motion to approve.

165
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:50,164
- Robert, motion to approve.
- Second.

166
00:06:50,164 --> 00:06:51,210
- And we have a second from Melissa.

167
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,233
Any discussion?

168
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,503
If not, all in favor, please say aye.

169
00:06:55,503 --> 00:06:56,336
Aye.
- Aye.

170
00:06:56,336 --> 00:06:57,390
- Opposed, please say no.

171
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,860
Hearing none, motion carries.

172
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,693
Thank you.

173
00:06:59,693 --> 00:07:00,526
Congratulations.

174
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:01,359
And 5B.

175
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:06,330
And again, I'll ask if anybody
has any conflicts of interest

176
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,460
they need to disclose, please let us know

177
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,080
if you've had any ex-parte communication,

178
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,330
research, site visits, et cetera.

179
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,563
Brenda?

180
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:15,208
Thank you.

181
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,277
- This next item is a land lease amendment

182
00:07:17,277 --> 00:07:21,930
for the property located at
the end of Patrick Street.

183
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,720
If this site does look
familiar, it was presented

184
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,080
to the Planning Advisory
Board back in July,

185
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,460
at the July 19th meeting last
year, for the Carter case.

186
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,330
At the time, the property owner

187
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,500
was in the process of
selling the property.

188
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,500
We changed the land use,
I believe, from airport,

189
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,230
I think it was the airport,
to low-density residential.

190
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,693
The property has since changed hands,

191
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,203
and hence the land use change.

192
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:54,397
Initially, this property was part

193
00:07:54,397 --> 00:07:58,530
of an inter-local agreement to
annex a number of properties

194
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,133
into the city, about 264
parcels, back in 2019.

195
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,580
That effort was part of, again,

196
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,540
to decrease these enclaves,
better provides services,

197
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,080
emergency services, garbage
collection, or what have you,

198
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,530
in coordination with
working with Osceola County.

199
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,330
With the change back
to industrial business,

200
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,026
staff is recommending
approval at this time,

201
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:27,510
and it's gonna be, I'm
finding more information

202
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,660
with the next item with the rezoning

203
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,000
as far as what the new owner

204
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,481
is intending to build on the property.

205
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,480
- Mm-hmm.

206
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,313
Okay.

207
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:38,570
Board, any questions for the city?

208
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,640
If not, is the applicant here?

209
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,322
And would you like to say
anything to the board?

210
00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:45,155
- I'm just here to answer questions.

211
00:08:45,155 --> 00:08:46,260
- Okay, you don't have to,

212
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,440
but you're welcome to if you'd like.

213
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,661
Do we have any public comments
regarding this agenda item?

214
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:52,826
Public comments?

215
00:08:52,826 --> 00:08:54,270
Public comments?

216
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,701
If not, board, do we have any
motions regarding this item?

217
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:01,101
- Motion to approve.
- Melissa, motion to approve.

218
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:02,520
- I'll second.
- We have second from Robert.

219
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,230
Any discussion?

220
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,389
If not, all in favor, please say aye.

221
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:07,222
- Aye.
- Aye.

222
00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:08,070
Opposed, please say no.

223
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,570
Hearing none, motion carries.

224
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,247
5C.

225
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:13,380
Again, if anybody is any
conflicts of interest,

226
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,630
please let that be known.

227
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,680
- So this is a companion
rezoning to rezone the property

228
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,800
from its current agricultural
conservation development

229
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,480
to business park.

230
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,800
Again, property was part of
that ILA before previously.

231
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,040
The reason why staff does not
want to rezone the property

232
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,040
to industrial to exactly match
the proposal to industrial

233
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,930
is because of the existing residential

234
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,090
that's nearby with it.

235
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,880
The surrounding property
to the east and south,

236
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,820
as noted on here, is the
business park, or BP,

237
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,220
and we felt that it was more appropriate

238
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,990
to rezone it to business park

239
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,840
so that would limit the type of uses

240
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,513
that could be reintroduced
on this property.

241
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,510
As of right now, there are
three different structures.

242
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,530
There is a duplex at 2810 and 2812,

243
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,013
about 4,000 square feet,
that was built in 1988.

244
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:22,971
There we go, put on there
so you can actually see it.

245
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:26,640
There's also, at 2804, is
a 1200 square foot building

246
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,350
that was built in 1939.

247
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,190
And at 2814 Patrick Street,

248
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,220
there's also another building,
about 3,000 square feet,

249
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,010
that was built in 1978.

250
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,960
Both buildings can remain on the site

251
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,300
and it can be used as residential

252
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,030
until such time that the applicant decides

253
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,680
to fully redevelop.

254
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,020
But it would be a legal non-conforming

255
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,390
that those structures can remain

256
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,192
until it's time to redevelop.

257
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:57,030
The applicant is intending
to have the storage

258
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,400
of exotic types of cars.

259
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,860
It's not a self-storage facility,

260
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,860
but it's just a structure to
house imported or exotic cars.

261
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,750
So we felt, again, this would
limit the type of industrial

262
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,020
or intense uses to the
residential area that's there.

263
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,370
And two, it would match

264
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,580
the existing business
park zoning designation

265
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,290
surrounding the undeveloped parcels

266
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,839
that's to the east and south.

267
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,080
So staff was recommending approval

268
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,343
subject to the approval
of the land use amendment.

269
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:30,677
I'm here to answer any questions,

270
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:33,263
and also the applicant owner as well.

271
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,423
- Board, are there any
questions for the city?

272
00:11:35,423 --> 00:11:36,315
Alex.

273
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:38,791
- So maybe I should have
asked with the last one,

274
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,220
but, yeah, I noticed that
the adjacent property

275
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,790
is right now is designated
as business park in zoning.

276
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,950
Is it also...

277
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,224
industrial business in the future land use

278
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:52,632
or is that a different designation,

279
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:55,132
for the surrounding property?

280
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:05,142
Yeah, okay.

281
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:08,114
I thought, I just, yeah,
wanted to double check.

282
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:08,947
- Yeah.

283
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:11,940
It does, and the zoning and
that land use is compatible.

284
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,450
Again, the difference is
business park is less intense.

285
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,150
It does allow for that
intense type of manufacturing,

286
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,740
allow for some light commercial,

287
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,714
but not intense type of manufacturing.

288
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:23,714
- Gotcha, thank you.

289
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,633
- Okay, any other questions for the city?

290
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:30,005
If not, would the applicant
like to say anything?

291
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:30,838
No?

292
00:12:30,838 --> 00:12:31,671
Okay.

293
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:33,132
Any public comments?

294
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:34,453
Public comments?

295
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,286
Public comments?

296
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:37,980
If not, any motions
regarding this agenda item

297
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,390
from the board.
- Make a motion to approve.

298
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,600
- Robert, we have a motion
to approve from Robert.

299
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,663
Do we have a second?

300
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:45,182
- Second.

301
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,015
- We have a second from Melissa.

302
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:46,848
Any discussion?

303
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:48,682
- No.

304
00:12:48,682 --> 00:12:50,403
- If not, all in favor, please say aye.

305
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,236
- Aye.
- Aye.

306
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:52,470
Opposed, please say no.

307
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,420
Hearing none, motion carries.

308
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,350
Thank you.

309
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,250
Congratulations.

310
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,400
And public hearings, do we have anything?

311
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,630
Nothing?

312
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,470
- We don't.

313
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,520
As of right now, I'm 99%
sure that we will not have

314
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,950
a February 21st Planning
Advisory Board meeting.

315
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,410
We don't have any
applications that are ready.

316
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:14,452
But I will confirm that
with a meeting cancellation.

317
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:15,285
- How are we gonna earn our pay here?

318
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:19,203
You need to maybe send Alicia
out with a sandwich board,

319
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,830
accepting applications for reasons.

320
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,454
No.
- Yeah.

321
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:25,287
- Brenda's good.

322
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:26,269
(chuckling)

323
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:27,102
- Yeah.

324
00:13:27,102 --> 00:13:29,910
Again, I do wanna apologize for
the lateness for the agenda.

325
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,130
Again, I was feeling under the weather,

326
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,630
but to provide that out to you.

327
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,850
The only thing that I
just wanted to reiterate

328
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,840
is to make sure

329
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,600
when we do send out
those email notifications

330
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,107
about a week before the
meetings, just to go ahead

331
00:13:42,107 --> 00:13:46,560
and to respond whether or not
you would be attending or not,

332
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,570
so that way, we're aware
of it moving forward.

333
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,570
I do understand that
things happen the day of,

334
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,000
but just respond so
that way we can confirm

335
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,787
with security and confirm
with the applicants

336
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,857
that we're gonna have the
meetings the week before.

337
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,643
- Okay.

338
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:02,993
Is it the pollen, you said?

339
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:06,433
- Pollen, what?
- The pollen.

340
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,816
- Oh yes, yes, I'm so out of it, yes.

341
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:10,147
- I have a white car and a black car.

342
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:11,430
Right now, they're both yellow, orange.

343
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,330
- Yes.
- Kind of.

344
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,210
- Mine is about the
yellow bumblebee, yeah,

345
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,810
color right now with the pollen.

346
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,590
- Suffering together.

347
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,423
Discussion.

348
00:14:20,423 --> 00:14:21,793
Board members?

349
00:14:21,793 --> 00:14:23,220
I have nothing.

350
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,450
Anyone?

351
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,460
Deputy City Attorney?

352
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,160
Alicia, Brenda, anyone?

353
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,993
Robert?

354
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:30,826
No?

355
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:31,659
Okay.

356
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:33,550
Anyone wanna make a motion to adjourn?

357
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,430
- I'll make a motion to adjourn.

358
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,750
- Robert, motion to adjourn.

359
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,616
Do we have a second?
- I second that.

360
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:38,449
- And we have a second from Melissa.

361
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:39,363
Any discussion on that?

362
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,191
Public comment?

363
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:43,024
No, okay.

364
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:44,942
All in favor, please say aye.

365
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:45,858
- Aye.
- Aye.

366
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:46,773
Opposed, please say no.

368

00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:54,003
I know, I know.
