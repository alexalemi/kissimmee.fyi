## Meeting Minutes Discussion

### Previous Minutes Approval (March 20th Meeting)
The Board engaged in an extensive discussion about the format and content of meeting minutes, which consumed a significant portion of the meeting.

**Key Points Discussed:**
- Board member Alex raised concerns about the level of detail in minutes, citing Robert's Rules of Order Section 48-2, which states minutes should contain "what was done at the meeting, not what was said"
- Staff explained that current minutes format follows City Clerk's Office training and policies, which provide more detail than strict Robert's Rules requirements to help City Commission understand discussion context
- City Attorney clarified that Florida statute does not specify exact requirements for minutes content, and Robert's Rules uses "should" rather than "shall" - creating flexibility
- Staff noted the meetings are audio recorded, providing verbatim backup if needed
- Discussion highlighted tension between Robert's Rules recommendations and City policy for maintaining more detailed minutes

**Action Taken:**
- Motion to amend March 20th minutes by striking specific dialogue paragraphs ("Board member Lenny asked," "Planning member Ryan stated," etc.)
- Motion passed to approve minutes with amendments
- Board consensus: Moving forward, minutes should be action-based rather than dialogue-heavy, pending clarification from City Clerk's Office on city-wide policies

## New Business

### Agenda Item 5A: City-Initiated Land Use Amendment - Armstrong Boulevard Industrial Area

**Project Overview:**
- Approximately 27 acres of properties on Armstrong Boulevard, north of the airport
- 14 total parcels, 6 currently vacant
- Proposed change: Mixed Use Vine (MUV) to Industrial (IN) future land use designation

**Staff Presentation (Brenda):**
- Area is an existing industrial hub with warehouses built between 1971-2008
- Current MUV designation established in 2010 (after most development occurred)
- City receiving increased requests for warehouse development on vacant properties
- Current MUV designation does not facilitate additional warehouse development
- Proposed change would allow industrial development but with reduced intensity:
  - Current FAR (Floor Area Ratio): 6.0
  - Proposed FAR: 0.5
- Intent: Allow warehousing compatible with existing development but at smaller scale
- Nearest residential areas: East side of Oak Street, Dyre Boulevard/Oak Street intersection
- Location benefits: Proximity to airport for logistics, air cargo, and transportation uses

**Board Discussion:**
Board member Alex raised several concerns:
1. **Incomplete Coverage:** One parcel (931 Armstrong Boulevard) would remain MUV, creating an enclave. Staff acknowledged this as an issue but explained they couldn't reach property owner for coordination.

2. **Land Use vs. Zoning Confusion:** Alex questioned whether MUV designation actually prohibits warehouses at the land use level (vs. zoning level). Staff explained that while land use is broad, the goals/objectives/policies of MUV are primarily commercial and don't support industrial uses.

3. **Comprehensive Plan Policy Conflicts:** Alex expressed concern that changing from mixed-use to single-use designation conflicts with:
   - Policy 1.1.5: Promoting land use strategies in Community Redevelopment Areas (CRA)
   - Policy 1.1.6.1: Enabling mixed-use transit development patterns within MMTD (Multi-Modal Transportation District)
   - These parcels are within the Vine Street CRA and MMTD

**Staff Response to Concerns:**
- Brenda emphasized that industrial is the most intense land use and requires careful consideration regarding mixed uses
- Residential shouldn't be mixed with industrial uses for safety/compatibility reasons
- This change cleans up inconsistency between existing zoning (PUD with industrial uses) and future land use designation
- Similar situation exists in Kelly Industrial Park area (east side of city)
- Properties would remain in Vine Street CRA despite land use change

**Chair's Comment:**
- Chair noted familiarity with the area (drives past 5 days/week to Osceola High School)
- Expressed no objection to industrial business designation based on existing conditions

**Public Comment:**
- No public comments provided

**Vote:**
- Motion to approve: Melissa Thacker
- Second: Robert Spalding
- Result: Motion carried with majority approval
- Alex voted No, citing concerns about unclear justification for land use change and potential violation of comprehensive plan policies regarding mixed-use development in MMTD

## Discussion Items

### Agenda Item 7A: Planning Advisory Board Workshop Planning

**Discussion:**
- Staff proposed scheduling a workshop but acknowledged summer timing is difficult
- Decision: Postpone workshop planning until after board vacancies are filled

**Topics Suggested for Future Workshop:**
- Robert's Rules of Order
- Comprehensive Plan overview
- Brownfield development (Board serves as city's Brownfield oversight body - many members unfamiliar with this role)
- Conflicts of interest
- General board duties and procedures

**Timing:**
- Tentatively looking at September/October 2024
- Would be scheduled on a meeting date with no other agenda items
- Could be split into multiple sessions if needed (e.g., one session on Robert's Rules/Comp Plan, another on other topics)
- Estimated 1 hour for Brownfield session

### Agenda Item 7B: Board Member Terms and Reappointments

**Board Member Status:**
- **Diana:** Term expires May 31, 2024 - pursuing reappointment, expected to go to City Commission in May
- **Fatima:** Term expires May 31, 2024 - **NOT seeking reappointment**, moving on to other endeavors
  - Board thanked Fatima for her service
  - She will continue serving until replacement is appointed
  - Replacement expected to be considered at second City Commission meeting in May
  - Each commissioner has responsibility for Advisory Board appointments on rotating basis

**Term Structure:**
- Terms are deliberately staggered (2 members expire each year: 2024, 2025, 2026)
- This prevents mass vacancies and ensures continuity

## Board Member Comments and Requests

### Alex's Additional Comments:

1. **Level of Service/Quality of Service Report Request:**
   - Comprehensive Plan was adopted in 2020 with 2030 goals for roadways, pedestrian, and bike infrastructure
   - Now halfway to 2030 targets
   - Alex requested update from city on current quality of service and progress toward goals
   - Staff noted city is preparing for state-required EAR (Evaluation and Appraisal Report)
   - City hiring transportation consultant; unclear if presentation will come to PAB
   - Chair suggested Alex could request this through staff channels rather than formal board motion

2. **Street Vacation Policy Reminder:**
   - Alex noted that after reviewing Comprehensive Plan Policy 2.2.1.2, the city should preserve existing right-of-way and not easily make street vacations
   - This relates to previous meeting's discussion (not detailed in this meeting)
   - Shared for board's future reference

3. **Comprehensive Plan Amendment Proposals:**
   - Alex identified policies in Osceola County's comprehensive plan that appear to be missing from Kissimmee's
   - Asked about board proposing amendments to comprehensive plan
   - City Attorney recommended working with staff first to understand if there's a reason for differences
   - Suggested vetting through staff before bringing to board
   - Alternative: Board members can raise issues directly with City Commission through public comments

4. **Question about "City Ditch":**
   - Alex asked about references to "city ditch" in comprehensive plan
   - Staff explained this refers to Mill Slough - a major ditch/drainage system traversing the city from south to north
   - Part of system follows Emory/Martin Luther King Boulevard
   - Portions have been piped in recent years

### Board Operations Issues:

**Microphone/Audio Quality:**
- Board members noted difficulty hearing clearly due to reverb/echo from microphones
- Particularly challenging from certain seating positions
- Issue noted but not resolved during meeting

2. **Industrial Development:** Approved land use change to support warehouse development near airport, though concerns raised about comprehensive plan policy alignment

3. **Board Transition:** Fatima departing after current term; replacement process underway through City Commission

4. **Workshop Planning:** Postponed until board fully staffed, likely September/October, will include Brownfield development education

5. **Active Board Engagement:** Board member Alex demonstrating detailed review of comprehensive plan and city code, raising substantive policy questions
