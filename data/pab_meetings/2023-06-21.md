## Agenda Items

### 1. Bass Road Townhomes - Zoning Map Amendment

**Applicant:** Miguel Kaled, 2305 Edgewater Drive, Orlando, FL 32804

**Request:** Ordinance amending the zoning map designation from Open Space to RC2 (Multiple Family Medium Density) for townhome development

**Property Details:**
- Property underwent annexation in 2019 as part of an interlocal agreement with Osceola County
- Approximately 200 properties were annexed during this process
- The conversion used comprehensive plan policy 1.1.10.5 to convert county land use and zoning to city designations
- Complies with existing future land use designation of multifamily medium density residential

**Development Concept:**
- Townhomes will face each other with a pedestrian-only corridor (approximately 50 feet wide) in the middle
- All garages will face outward, away from the central corridor
- No cars will be parked in front of units
- Design creates a contained, family-friendly environment without fences, particularly beneficial for families with children
- Developer has prior experience with similar developments in Kissimmee

**Review Process:**
- Development Review Committee recommended approval at May 16, 2023 meeting
- No public comments received prior to the meeting

  - Other standard site plan requirements apply

**Board Action:** Unanimously approved

**Background:**
- Property has received notices of violation and has an open code enforcement case

- Pedestrian access improvements

**Use Restrictions:**
- Approval is for office use only
- Current use: Tax/accounting office
- Due to parking limitations, property can only support administrative offices
- Would not accommodate higher parking demand uses such as medical/doctor's offices

**Review Process:**
