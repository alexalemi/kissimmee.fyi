## Main Agenda Items

### Item 5A: Conditional Use with Site Plan - Chiropractic Office with Live-Work Unit

**Location:** South side of Vine Street
**Property Size:** 0.2 acres
**Applicant Representative:** Lee Hale (111 South Maitland Avenue, Maitland, Florida)

#### Project Details:
- 3,000 square foot building proposal
- First floor: 1,500 sq ft chiropractic office
- Second floor: 1,500 sq ft residential unit
- This will be the **first live-work unit in the City of Kissimmee**

#### Key Distinctions Explained:

**Home Occupation vs. Live-Work Unit:**
- Home occupation: Limits customer presence, primarily computer-based work with no customer visits
- Live-work unit: Encourages customer interaction, allows business operations with customer visits while property owner resides on-site

#### Incentives & Requirements:

**Form-Based Code Incentives (Vine Street Corridor):**
- Property street frontage waiver: Normal requirement waived for live-work units (property has 52% frontage instead of required minimum)
- Bicycle locker incentive: Each bicycle locker reduces parking requirement by 2 spaces (city-wide incentive)

#### Conditions of Approval:
1. Must remain as live-work unit (cannot separate business and residential components)
2. Residential unit cannot be rented separately to someone who doesn't operate the first-floor business
3. If use changes, additional parking or site improvements would be required
4. Fence required to buffer existing Orange Gardens residential community to the south
5. Bicycle lockers to be provided

#### Comparable Examples:
- Similar live-work units exist in Celebration and City of Orlando
- Internally connected design allows professional practice space with residential living

**Public Comment:** None
**Board Discussion:** No questions for city staff or applicant
**Decision:** Motion to approve by Robert, seconded by Melissa - **Approved unanimously**

### Item 5B: Land Use Amendment - Patrick Street Property

**Location:** End of Patrick Street
**Previous Appearance:** Property was presented to Planning Advisory Board in July 2023 (July 19th meeting) for the Carter case

#### Background:
- Property was part of 2019 inter-local agreement (ILA) with Osceola County
- ILA involved annexing 264 parcels into the city to:
  - Decrease enclaves
  - Better provide services (emergency services, garbage collection, etc.)
  - Coordinate with Osceola County
- Original land use change: from Airport to Low-Density Residential (for previous owner/Carter case)
- Property has since changed ownership

#### Proposed Change:
- Change land use to Industrial Business (to accommodate new owner's plans)
- Details of new owner's intended use to be covered in companion rezoning item (5C)

**Public Comment:** None
**Board Discussion:** Applicant present but chose not to make statement, only available for questions. No questions from board.
**Decision:** Motion to approve by Melissa, seconded by Robert - **Approved unanimously**

### Item 5C: Rezoning - Patrick Street Property (Companion to 5B)

**Current Zoning:** Agricultural Conservation Development
**Proposed Zoning:** Business Park (BP)
**Applicant's Request:** Industrial zoning
**Staff Recommendation:** Business Park instead of Industrial

#### Staff Rationale for Business Park Zoning:
1. **Compatibility with existing residential:** Nearby residential uses warrant less intense zoning
2. **Consistency with surrounding area:** Adjacent properties to east and south already zoned Business Park
3. **Use limitations:** Business Park limits types of allowed uses compared to Industrial
   - Allows light commercial
   - Allows some manufacturing, but not intense manufacturing
   - More appropriate transition to residential areas

#### Existing Structures on Property:

1. **2810-2812 Patrick Street:** Duplex, 4,000 sq ft (built 1988)
2. **2804 Patrick Street:** 1,200 sq ft building (built 1939)
3. **2814 Patrick Street:** 3,000 sq ft building (built 1978)

#### Legal Non-Conforming Status:
- All existing residential structures can remain on site
- Can continue to be used as residential until applicant decides to fully redevelop
- Structures grandfathered as legal non-conforming uses

#### Intended Future Use:
- Storage facility for exotic/imported cars
- **NOT** a self-storage facility
- Specialized structure to house high-end imported or exotic vehicles

#### Board Questions:
- **Alex** asked about adjacent property designations, confirming that surrounding properties have both Business Park zoning and Industrial Business land use designation
- Staff confirmed land use and zoning are compatible
- Business Park is less intense than Industrial zoning

**Public Comment:** None
**Applicant Statement:** Declined to make statement, available for questions only
**Decision:** Motion to approve by Robert, seconded by Melissa - **Approved unanimously**
