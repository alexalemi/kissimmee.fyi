**Environmental Protections:**
- 177 acres of wetlands preserved

**Staff Recommendation:** Approval with revised conditions

**Public Comments:**
Multiple residents from surrounding areas (primarily Hilliard Isle neighborhood) expressed concerns:

1. **Dr. Brian Agard (2423 Aurora Court):**
   - Concerned about buffer zone between Aurora Court and development
   - Wants involvement in future planning meetings
   - Lifestyle concerns

2. **Elizabeth Pimentel (2685 Hilliard Court):**
   - Significant traffic concerns at Hilliard Court and Simpson Road intersection
   - Currently has to adjust work schedule due to traffic congestion
   - Bus stops cause major delays
   - Street expansion needed before any development
   - Safety concerns for children at bus stops
   - Purchased property specifically for rural lifestyle with farm views

3. **General Concerns Raised:**
   - Existing traffic issues on Simpson Road
   - School capacity
   - Loss of rural character
   - Impact on property values
   - Construction traffic

**City Staff Clarifications:**
- Brenda Ryan (planning staff) clarified that the hearing focuses on zoning establishment, not specific design details
- Detailed site plans, road layouts, and architectural specifics will come later
- MUPUD zoning creates cohesive community planning framework
- Mixed Use Planned Unit Development is progressive, organized approach to city planning
- Transportation analysis complicated because Simpson Road is county road, not city road
- County responsible for Simpson Road improvements (currently underway)
- Development will meet various comprehensive plan goals across multiple elements (conservation, economic, transportation)

**Board Discussion:**
Alex raised several concerns and observations:
- Difficulty: Area not well-addressed in current comprehensive plan (mostly newly annexed)
- However, proposal generally aligns with Kissimmee's comprehensive plan priorities
- Strong focus on walkability and mixed use
- Residents should be able to conduct business within community without driving
- Some concerns about whether walkability goals fully met (east end of development 45 minutes walk from mixed use area)
- Transportation/transit elements don't fully address this area
- Many concerned residents are Osceola County residents, not Kissimmee residents
- Acknowledged this is enclave property
- Questioned whether comprehensive plan adequately addresses this magnitude of development
- Clarified understanding of bus depot prohibition vs. bus transit stops

Other board members expressed concerns about:
- Traffic impacts
- School capacity impacts (particularly given personal experience with schools)
- Long-term community changes

**Decision:** Approved with revised conditions (18 conditions)
**Vote:** 5-0 with one abstention
- Motion: Robert Spalding (to approve with 18 revised conditions)
- Second: Fatima
- Abstention: Melissa Thacker (declared conflict of interest)

## Key Themes and Concerns

### Traffic and Infrastructure
- Simpson Road congestion is significant existing problem
- Osceola County actively working on road improvements and signals
- Improvements expected before major development occurs
- Emergency-only access points to prevent cut-through traffic in neighborhoods

### School Capacity
- No traditional school capacity report provided at this stage
- Mitigation required and will be re-evaluated every 3 years
- More detailed analysis to come with site plan submissions
- Board members expressed concern about school system impacts

### Community Character
- Residents value rural/agricultural character of area
- Concerns about lifestyle changes from development
- Some residents specifically moved to area for existing character
- Development represents transition from rural to suburban/urban

### Process and Procedure
- Meeting focused on zoning approval, not detailed site plans
- Many public concerns addressed issues outside scope of zoning hearing
- Future meetings will address specific design, traffic, and infrastructure details
- MUPUD provides framework for phased, cohesive development

## Notes

This was a lengthy and complex meeting, with the Harriet Isle MUPUD (Item 5D) taking up the majority of the time. The board carefully considered a major development that will significantly impact the eastern part of Kissimmee. While approving the zoning, board members acknowledged concerns about traffic, schools, and community character. The phased approach and ongoing mitigation requirements provide mechanisms for addressing impacts as development proceeds.

The meeting demonstrated tension between development needs and existing community character, particularly given the area's recent annexation into city limits. Staff emphasized that this zoning approval establishes the framework, with many details to be worked out in subsequent site plan reviews.
