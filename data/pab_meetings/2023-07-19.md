## Agenda Items

### 1. Minutes Approval (Items 3A & 3B)
**Action Taken:** Approved minutes from two previous meetings:
- June 7th minutes - Motion by Robert, Second by Alex - Approved unanimously
- June 21st minutes - Motion by Diana, Second by Robert - Approved unanimously

### 2. Proposed Ordinance 23-15 (Item 5A) - Future Land Use Amendment

**Project Description:**
- City-initiated future land use amendment
- Change designation from Industrial Business to Single Family, Low Density Residential
- Location: East of Gateway Airport, near Osceola High School, at the dead end of Patrick Street
- Part of 2019 Small Enclaves Interlocal Agreement (ILA) with county involving 265 total parcels

**Background:**
- Parcel was one of 264 properties annexed from county in 2019
- ILA targeted areas to improve services (garbage collection, emergency response)
- Scrivener's errors occurred during transition from county to city land use designations
- Property previously had low density residential designation under county jurisdiction

**Staff Recommendation:** Approval - designation is consistent with surrounding residential areas (Marion Avenue subdivision, Brian Street residential area) and compatible with companion zoning change

**Discussion Points:**
- Board member Alex questioned whether landowner authorization existed for the land use change specifically
- Email authorization was included in supporting documents but referenced agricultural/conservation zoning more explicitly than land use designation
- Staff acknowledged the email language could have been more specific but confirmed authorization was obtained
- Alex Lanny (new board member) asked about difference between land use and zoning:
  - Land use: State-required comprehensive planning designation setting general density/intensity (10-20 year horizon)
  - Zoning: More detailed specifications including setbacks, height requirements, specific permitted uses

**Public Comment:** None

**Action Taken:**
- Motion to approve by Robert
- Second by Diana
- Approved unanimously (no opposition)

### 3. Proposed Ordinance 23-16 (Item 5B) - Zoning Map Amendment

**Project Description:**
- Companion zoning map amendment to Item 5A
- Change zoning from Airport Industrial to Agricultural and Conservation (AC)
- Same property as Item 5A

**Background:**
- Also part of 2019 Small Enclaves ILA correction
- Property currently has at least three individual single family homes
- AC zoning acts as a "holding zone" compatible with single family low density residential use
- Allows flexibility until property owner determines specific development plans
- Consistent with adjacent residential development

**Staff Recommendation:** Approval subject to approval of land use amendment (Item 5A)

**Public Comment:** None

**Action Taken:**
- Motion to approve by Diana
- Second by Robert
- Approved unanimously (no opposition)

### 4. Conditional Use with Site Specific Redevelopment Plan (Item 5C)

**Project Description:**
- Applicant: Park Place (represented by Steve Ivans, Board of Directors member, filling in for CEO Jim Shanks who was hospitalized)
- Location: Southeast corner of Dillingham Avenue and James Street
- Property size: 0.78 acres (vacant parcel)
- Zoning: T4R (Neighborhood Resident Restricted)
- Proposed use: Eight-unit, single-story multifamily residential development
- Project name: "Res Four"

**Project Purpose:**
- Transitional housing for individuals who have completed rehabilitation programs
- Not a rehabilitation facility itself - residents have already graduated from rehab
- Seven to 12-month program providing counseling and support
- Helps residents avoid returning to negative environments
- Four apartments with eight beds total (one person per unit)
- Includes kitchen facilities and counseling room
- Residents encouraged to find employment, most use public transportation or bikes

**Operational Details:**
- Funding through state grants based on number of beds
- No on-site staff monitoring - residents have independence similar to regular housing
- Counselors visit for sessions
- Optional program - residents could return home but encouraged to participate
- Preference/requirement to come through Park Place's rehabilitation program first
- Replaces previous facility (old motel) that was demolished for apartment project on June Street

**Site Plan Review:**
- Reviewed and approved by Development Review Committee
- Consistent with form-based code standards
- Meets all geometric requirements: setbacks, coverage, parking, buffers
- Adjacent to AD designated flood plain (at property edge)
- Flood elevation details to be reviewed by engineering department during construction phase
- Board member Alex inquired about base elevation requirements - staff confirmed this is handled by public works engineering in construction plan phase, not site plan phase

**Board Discussion:**
- Questions about qualification criteria for residents
- Clarification that this is transitional housing, not active rehabilitation
- Questions about supervision and monitoring (none on-site)
- Discussion of progression: jail → halfway house → improvement → transition house
- Chairman disclosed being on board of directors of Opportunity Center (nearby) but stated no conflict of interest

**Public Comment:** None

**Staff Recommendation:** Approval subject to conditions in staff report

**Action Taken:**
- Motion to approve by Robert
- Second by Diana
- Approved unanimously (no opposition)
