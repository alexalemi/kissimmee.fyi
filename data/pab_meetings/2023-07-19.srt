1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,400
- Going to ask everybody,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,140
silence your devices please,
including board members.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,880
And we're going to stand please,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,120
ask everybody to stand
for a moment of silence

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,537
and the Pledge of Allegiance.

6
00:00:22,437 --> 00:00:23,742
- I pledge allegiance to the flag

7
00:00:23,742 --> 00:00:25,883
of the United States of America

8
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:28,210
and to the republic for which it stands

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,689
one nation, under God, indivisible

10
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:35,136
with liberty and justice for all.

11
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:36,136
- Thank you.

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,230
Item four, old business, nothing there.

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,000
Five. I'm sorry.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,140
Let me say three, minutes.

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,465
Sorry. Three A, approval
of June 7th minutes.

16
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:48,298
- We motion to approve.

17
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,280
- Motion to approve from
Robert, do we have second?

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,438
- Second.

19
00:00:51,438 --> 00:00:53,340
- We have second from Alex.

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,080
And all in favor?

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,700
- Aye.
- Aye.

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,533
- Aye.

23
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:58,366
- Opposed?

24
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:00,090
Hearing none, minutes are approved.

25
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,240
Three B approval of June 21st meeting.

26
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,233
Do we have a motion?

27
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:05,066
- Motion.

28
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:06,953
- Motion approved, Diana.

29
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:07,786
- Second.

30
00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:10,590
- Second, Robert. Any discussion changes

31
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,910
on favor, please say aye.

32
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,840
- Aye.
- Aye.

33
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,863
- Oppose, please say no.

34
00:01:13,863 --> 00:01:16,230
Hearing none, minutes are approved.

35
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,940
Old business, nothing there.

36
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,053
Five A proposed ordinance number 23-15.

37
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,770
- Yes, this is a future
land use amendment.

38
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,643
It's actually a city initiated
future land use amendment

39
00:01:29,643 --> 00:01:31,860
to change the land use designation

40
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,620
from industrial business to single family,

41
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,510
low density, residential.

42
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,309
This property as well as 264 other parcels

43
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:44,520
were part of a small
enclaves interlocal agreement

44
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,594
or ILA with the.

45
00:01:46,594 --> 00:01:47,427
- I'm sorry Brenda.

46
00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:50,349
Are we supposed to have
this on our monitors here?

47
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:51,422
- Oh yes. I'm sorry.

48
00:01:51,422 --> 00:01:53,370
The monitors are probably
not turned on here.

49
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,545
- Sorry.

50
00:01:54,545 --> 00:01:55,378
- The far right.

51
00:01:55,378 --> 00:01:56,211
- Okay.

52
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:58,233
- First one. Yeah. Yes.

53
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:00,437
- Okay, thank you. I got it. Sorry

54
00:02:00,437 --> 00:02:01,980
- So this parcel here.

55
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,480
So just general here, it's just
east of the Gateway Airport

56
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,000
and what you see here
with the baseball fields

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,310
and the tracks, that's
Osceola High School.

58
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,956
So at the end of in Backer is
going to be east just outside

59
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:18,090
of view here at the dead end of Patrick.

60
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,248
- So this parcel, actually
it's two parcels here,

61
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:25,599
was part of that
interlocal agreement, 2019

62
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,953
in addition to 264 other parcels.

63
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:33,150
That initiative with
the ILA was to address

64
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,810
and target certain areas
where we had enclaves

65
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,610
and try to improve services
such as garbage collection

66
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,633
and also improve emergency
services responses too, as well.

67
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:52,310
But with that, because
there's 264 parcels,

68
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,580
the land use designations,

69
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,430
we tried to establish
something that was comparable

70
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,030
to what the future language
designation was in the county.

71
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,023
Unfortunately there were
some scrivener errors

72
00:03:02,023 --> 00:03:04,710
and inconsistencies with the transition

73
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,670
of the county future land
use destination and the city.

74
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,150
So we are correcting this
one here with this property

75
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,140
had a low density
residential county land use.

76
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,192
So we are correcting this
with this amendment to

77
00:03:19,192 --> 00:03:22,320
change that land use designation
to the single family,

78
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,962
low density, residential,
comparable to what it was

79
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:27,213
before it was annexed to the city.

80
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,000
The low density residential
is also consistent

81
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:35,730
with the, there's some small
different residential areas.

82
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,420
You see there Marion Avenue
is a small little subdivision.

83
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,460
And then of course on
the northeast corner here

84
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,515
at Brian Street there is residential.

85
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:49,257
So this change is consistent
with the surround area

86
00:03:49,257 --> 00:03:51,420
and it's also going to be consistent

87
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,420
with the zoning map amendment
which will be heard next.

88
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,230
And it's consistent

89
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,150
with the land development
code requirements too.

90
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,153
So therefore staff is recommending
approval at this time.

91
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:04,858
- Thank you.

92
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:08,487
Board members, any questions
or comments for the city?

93
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:09,320
- Yeah, I guess I.

94
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,237
- Go ahead, Alex.

95
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:11,393
- I have a quick question.

96
00:04:11,393 --> 00:04:12,297
I was looking through the agenda

97
00:04:12,297 --> 00:04:15,630
and I noticed that there
was an email between Greg

98
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,482
and the landowners regarding
I think item five B,

99
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:21,086
not five A specifically. I think.

100
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:23,143
- it was actually both.

101
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:27,690
I think in the background
for the support documents,

102
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,980
I think it was in both.

103
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,030
It should be in both

104
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,229
because the property owners,
are item 5A and 5B is

105
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:36,094
for the same property.

106
00:04:36,094 --> 00:04:37,927
- Yeah, I understand
it's the same property.

107
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:40,277
I guess I just wanted to double check.

108
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:41,760
It seemed like it was indicated

109
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,810
in the supporting documents

110
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,357
that the landowner were reached out to

111
00:04:44,357 --> 00:04:47,700
and they agreed with the
switch to agricultural

112
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,190
and conservation zoning change,

113
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,171
which I think is item five B.

114
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:53,417
I was wondering whether it is important

115
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:55,080
'cause I wasn't seeing evidence

116
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,613
that they supported the change

117
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:59,190
in the future land use map designation.

118
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,282
Whether that was
important or necessary or.

119
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:05,585
- It was and I thought it
was part of the supporting.

120
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:08,220
I thought that same email was
part of the supporting doc.

121
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,510
It should be with this
item five A too, as well.

122
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,960
It should be and if it wasn't
then that was an error.

123
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,860
But I could have sworn

124
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,557
that it was in there because
it's the same property owner,

125
00:05:20,557 --> 00:05:23,190
but moving forward it should be part

126
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,182
of this land use authorization.

127
00:05:26,182 --> 00:05:28,150
I thought it was in the the overall,

128
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,505
it's the overall packet,
the overall packet.

129
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:33,893
- I guess maybe a naive question,

130
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:36,829
but could you help me out I guess,

131
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:39,234
what's the kind of primary difference

132
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:41,051
between the zoning map designation

133
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:43,338
and the future land use map designation?

134
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:45,993
- So within the state of Florida,

135
00:05:45,993 --> 00:05:48,240
'cause we are a
comprehensive planning state,

136
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,568
so the state requires

137
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:52,230
that every jurisdiction
maintains a comprehensive plan

138
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,590
of just general types of land uses.

139
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,290
The requirement is those
land uses generally

140
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,983
dictate the number, the density,
the dwelling units per acre

141
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,400
or if it's commercial, floor area ratio.

142
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,423
Each city or jurisdiction
may have different goals

143
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:10,710
or objectives in the future.

144
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,040
There usually 10 to 20 year
horizons of just generally

145
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,750
of how a local organization
wants to grow or to improve.

146
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,863
So that's land use
which is this item here.

147
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:25,220
When you establish the land use,

148
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,600
the zoning pretty much will hone down

149
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,540
and make it much more
particular about this.

150
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,640
Land use has a certain types

151
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,130
of zoning that is compatible with it.

152
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,010
The zoning's going to get much
more detail about setbacks,

153
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,800
about different random height requirements

154
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,193
and those types of things.

155
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,850
Land use is overall general,

156
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,428
it pretty much sets the
foundation for the zoning

157
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:52,560
that can be selected or
is compatible with it,

158
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,393
in a nutshell.

159
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,409
- Thank you.

160
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,580
- The authorization?

161
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,400
That's going to be at the bottom.

162
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,336
Yeah. So we're going to, as
I move, I want to make sure,

163
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:08,310
but if not it should be
under both to make sure

164
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,376
that it is.

165
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:11,987
We got the authorization
from the property owner

166
00:07:11,987 --> 00:07:15,803
for us to present this as
a city initiated change.

167
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:20,580
- Okay. Yeah, I guess in
reading the documents,

168
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,450
it seems like,

169
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,400
I think the emails are included
in the supporting documents

170
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,163
for both, but the actual text
to the emails was making,

171
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:29,100
it seemed like was making
reference specifically

172
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,900
to the agricultural and conservation.

173
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,010
- Oh I see what you're saying.

174
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,780
The actual, I see, okay, I get it.

175
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,643
The content in the email, I
see what you're saying. Okay.

176
00:07:37,643 --> 00:07:41,256
- Is that a potential
issue or is that okay?

177
00:07:41,256 --> 00:07:44,390
- It's not, but if it
means as a comfort level

178
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,582
moving it forward

179
00:07:45,582 --> 00:07:48,467
then we can reach back
out to the property owner

180
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,550
to ask them the question,

181
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:54,106
Do we have your authorization to also

182
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,699
change the future land designation?

183
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:57,780
If you can, do you think
you can drag that email.

184
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,075
So that way what he's saying
is that it was attached

185
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:05,579
under both but the conversation
was just about zoning

186
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:07,078
and not land use.

187
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:09,976
I see what you're saying.

188
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:13,957
Yeah. Here. It was just
the conversation just only

189
00:08:13,957 --> 00:08:15,450
addressed the zoning.

190
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,997
But it says and changing
the land use too, as well.

191
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,390
But it didn't spell out
exactly the single family,

192
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,150
low density, residential land use.

193
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,900
So I understand what you're saying.

194
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,373
- Thank you.

195
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:31,413
- Board, any other questions or comments?

196
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:36,582
If not, is the landowner
here to make any comment?

197
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,630
- The landowner is not so
that's why that authorization to

198
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,420
allow us to do a city
initiate and to represent,

199
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,244
for the city staff to
represent the property owner.

200
00:08:45,244 --> 00:08:47,079
- Okay. We'll open up any public comments,

201
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:49,290
any members of the public
want to make any comments

202
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,673
regarding this agenda item?

203
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,220
Any public comments?

204
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,500
No. Okay.

205
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,233
Board, do we have motion
regarding this agenda item?

206
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,820
- I'll make a motion to approve it.

207
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,906
- Robert, we have motion
from Roberts to approve.

208
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:08,167
Second, do we have a second?

209
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,000
- Second

210
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,990
- Second from Diana.

211
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,273
Any conversation about
this? Any discussion?

212
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,300
If not, all in favor, please say aye.

213
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,133
- Aye.
- Aye.

214
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,140
- Opposed? Please say no.

215
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:24,140
Hearing none, motion carries 5B 23-16.

216
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,140
- Yes, this is the companion
zoning map amendment to

217
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,570
change the zoning on these properties

218
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,570
from airport industrial to
agricultural and conservation.

219
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,460
Like I mentioned before, it was part

220
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,460
of the small enclaves ILA
back in 2019, 264 properties,

221
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:47,765
the long list of different,
a table of different changes.

222
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:49,916
So as these scrivener's error.

223
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,050
Now when it comes to the agricultural

224
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,529
and conservation development,

225
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:57,900
that zoning is compatible
with single family,

226
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,671
low density, residential and
it acts as a holding zone

227
00:10:01,671 --> 00:10:05,277
when perhaps the property
owner does not really

228
00:10:05,277 --> 00:10:07,620
know exactly what they're going to build.

229
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,890
Our comp plan allows that AC zoning to act

230
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,910
as a holding zone until such
time they're able to redevelop.

231
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,338
At this point in time there are

232
00:10:17,338 --> 00:10:20,790
at least three different
individual single family homes

233
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,693
on that property.

234
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:26,370
Being that it is existing
development and like I mentioned

235
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,893
that there is residential
development adjacent to it,

236
00:10:31,077 --> 00:10:33,960
that feels that it's appropriate
to rezone this property

237
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,083
to agricultural and
conservation development.

238
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,860
At this time, SAC is
recommending approval subject

239
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,253
to the approval of the land use amendment.

240
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,500
- Okay. Board, any comments or questions

241
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,664
for the city? If not,

242
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:51,995
do we have any public
comments regarding this piece

243
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:53,730
of the agenda?

244
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,620
Any public comments?

245
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,663
If not, anyone like to make a motion?

246
00:10:58,551 --> 00:10:59,694
- Motion to approve.

247
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:01,470
- Motion to approve,
Diana. Do we have a second?

248
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,941
- I'll second.

249
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:03,774
- We have a second.

250
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:06,660
Robert, any discussion? No. Okay.

251
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,980
All in favor, please say aye.

252
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,030
- Aye.
- Aye.

253
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,380
- Opposed, please say no.

254
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,270
Hearing none, motion carries.

255
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,890
Five C, conditional use

256
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,670
with site specific
redevelopment plan request.

257
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,503
- Good evening.

258
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:23,040
The applicant has found a
conditional use application

259
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,633
for multifamily use.

260
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,110
Subject property is located

261
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,200
on the southeast corner of
Dilingham Avenue and James Street

262
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,533
as you can see here,
delineated on your screens.

263
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,537
Subject property consists
of a vacant parcel,

264
00:11:39,537 --> 00:11:44,537
total of land area, 0.78 acres of land.

265
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:47,251
Subject property is located

266
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:52,001
in a T4R neighborhood resident
restricted zoning district

267
00:11:52,874 --> 00:11:55,470
which allows multifamily uses subject

268
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,813
to the approval of the
conditional use permit.

269
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:03,378
The request is for an
eight unit, multifamily,

270
00:12:03,378 --> 00:12:07,145
single story residential development.

271
00:12:07,145 --> 00:12:09,960
The staff has reviewed the
project and it is consistent

272
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,920
with the form-based code standards set

273
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,620
forth by the lab development code.

274
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,050
This project was reviewed and approved

275
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,130
by the development review committee

276
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,350
and staff is recommending approval subject

277
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,600
to conditions contained
in your staff report.

278
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:26,359
This concludes my report.

279
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:29,610
I'll be happy to answer
any questions you may have.

280
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:33,273
- Board, any comments or
questions for the city?

281
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:35,790
Alex, go ahead.

282
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,100
- So looking through the
supporting documents I noticed

283
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,820
that it was mentioned
that this lot is adjacent

284
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,733
to a flood plain, an AD
designated flood plan,

285
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,700
which it does seem like it is,

286
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,680
just on the edge of the property.

287
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,520
And so there was a condition stipulated

288
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,150
by the city that suggested that
the plan include information

289
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,490
about the base elevation
of the ground floor.

290
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,380
I wasn't able to see that
in the supporting documents.

291
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,120
Is that, I guess, would that be required

292
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,513
at a later stage given
approval or is that?

293
00:13:05,513 --> 00:13:08,670
- That is actually reviewed
by our engineering department.

294
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:13,670
They have flood maps which are
consistent with their code.

295
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,620
It's mostly engineering that handles that.

296
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,440
As far as the development
or the land development code

297
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,000
within our planning section,
it does only mentioned

298
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
the geometrics, setbacks, coverage,

299
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,970
parking, buffers, making sure

300
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,170
that the adjacent residential
uses are not impacted.

301
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,690
Therefore we're reviewing
that now to make sure

302
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,607
that we have adequate spacing

303
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:48,270
which we have reviewed and
it meets all the standards.

304
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:52,410
But as far as flood zones and that nature,

305
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,280
it is public works engineering
that handle that aspect

306
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,416
of this project.

307
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,737
And they actually review that

308
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,743
and include documentation
within the review.

309
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,334
But in the later, after this is approved,

310
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:07,560
they will move into the construction phase

311
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,820
where it will be reviewed
under those sections required

312
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,663
by their codes.

313
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,850
- Thank you

314
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,683
- You welcome.

315
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:18,810
- I also want to remind
all the board members

316
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,790
that if there are any
conflicts of interest

317
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:25,597
or you've had any ex parte
conversations or prior research

318
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:28,623
on any of the items,
please let that be known.

319
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,529
Do we have the applicant here?

320
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:37,708
Would the applicant
like to step to the mic

321
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,375
and say a few words?

322
00:14:41,853 --> 00:14:43,530
Please state your name
and your business address

323
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,630
for the record please.

324
00:14:49,543 --> 00:14:50,970
- My name is Steve Ivans.

325
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,420
I am on the Board of
Directors for Park Place.

326
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,900
I'm kind of pinch hitting
for Jim Shanks, the CO.

327
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,703
He's sick today.

328
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:07,500
This project is called Res four.

329
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,920
It's for people that
have come out of rehab

330
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,980
and rather than they go
back to a bad environment,

331
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,183
they come here for seven to
12 months and get counseling.

332
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,950
We have a current operation,

333
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,842
I don't know if that's the right word,

334
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:29,842
but we had a facility that
it was an old motel I guess,

335
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,730
and that was knocked down

336
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,790
and the building across June
Street Apartment Project

337
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,080
and those people are being housed

338
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,360
in an old house somewhere temporarily

339
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,297
until this project goes.

340
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:52,200
And I'm here to answer any
questions you may have,

341
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,790
anyone has, and our
engineers there, Steve Boyd,

342
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,343
to any technical questions you might have.

343
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,004
- Board, any questions?

344
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:05,386
- Yeah, is this a rehabilitation?

345
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:08,580
- No, I wouldn't call it rehabilitation.

346
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,019
When they're in rehab,

347
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,590
that would be in my mind, rehabilitation.

348
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,330
This is when they've graduated from that

349
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,950
and this has a kitchen facility.

350
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,344
They come and they learn, you know,

351
00:16:22,344 --> 00:16:23,217
they live on alone basically.

352
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:26,242
And there's a room for
a counselor to come in.

353
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:28,337
- So this is like a transition house to?

354
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:31,981
- Yes, I'd call it a
transition house, yes.

355
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:35,370
- Is there a certain amount
of time that they must be

356
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,403
in rehab before this becomes
a possibility for them?

357
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,037
Is there any minimum time
that they have to be in rehab?

358
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,280
- Well, like I said,
it's not really rehab.

359
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,255
- No. They were in rehab.

360
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:49,910
Is there a minimum time that
they have to be in rehab

361
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,320
before they transition into this?

362
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,150
- I'm not qualified to
answer that question.

363
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,250
I don't know.

364
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:00,810
- Anyone else?

365
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,640
- How much does it, I see four.

366
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,990
Is it four?

367
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,210
How many people can fit in this?

368
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,469
What are we looking at
here as far as residence?

369
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:09,302
- Total of eight units.

370
00:17:09,302 --> 00:17:13,053
There'll be four in four apartments.

371
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,593
We had room for more on the
property, but we get money

372
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,990
from the state to pay
for the beds basically.

373
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,470
And that's how the
business runs more or less.

374
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,440
You get grants to operate that depending

375
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,670
on the number of beds.

376
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,770
And that's the number of beds we have and.

377
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:37,004
- What was the total number of beds?

378
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:38,353
I'm sorry I missed that.

379
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:39,186
- Eight.

380
00:17:39,186 --> 00:17:43,200
- Eight. Okay. So one
person per unit. Okay.

381
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,193
- Robert, did you have something else?

382
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:47,897
- No. No.

383
00:17:47,897 --> 00:17:50,980
- Okay. So the eight that are there,

384
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,460
what are the qualifications

385
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,000
for the people who are housed there?

386
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,973
What is the criteria I
guess for the individuals?

387
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,580
- They've come from another
program that Park Place runs,

388
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,140
I guess. I think you,
I'm pretty sure you have

389
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:18,630
and I'm just kind of guessing
here, you have to come

390
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,770
through the Park Place
program of rehabilitation

391
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,200
and then then you can come to this.

392
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,900
I don't know that they would take,

393
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:30,810
let's say someone off the street.

394
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,036
Not to say they wouldn't, but I just think

395
00:18:33,036 --> 00:18:36,780
that you're part of a
program being counseled

396
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,481
and there's counselors
and probably, you know,

397
00:18:40,481 --> 00:18:43,203
maybe some medicine, you
know, that sort of thing.

398
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:47,106
I wish I knew more and Jim
was supposed to be here,

399
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:49,408
but he's basically, he's in the hospital.

400
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:53,158
He's sick. So I can't
answer those questions.

401
00:18:54,495 --> 00:18:55,662
- Okay. Diana.

402
00:18:57,213 --> 00:18:58,560
- Just one last question.

403
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,720
When they're living there, there's no one

404
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,810
on staff that's actually
more monitoring these

405
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,870
or that's there with them? It's all.

406
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,386
- Correct. At this point,

407
00:19:09,386 --> 00:19:11,973
they could go home if they wanted to.

408
00:19:11,973 --> 00:19:12,947
- Okay.

409
00:19:12,947 --> 00:19:16,549
- Okay. But a lot of these
people are in a bad situation

410
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:21,549
with people that would
probably easily get them back

411
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,000
in some addiction. Right?

412
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,740
So they want to get them away

413
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,740
from a bad environment,
keep them, you know,

414
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,810
walking a straight path, so to speak.

415
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,970
So it's an, I think, I'm pretty
sure it's an optional thing.

416
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,600
They encourage you to go
here and why wouldn't you?

417
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,460
It's new and clean and
you know, so they could

418
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,360
if they wanted to go home,

419
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,260
they're encourage you to get jobs too.

420
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:51,119
Most of them, it's been our experienced,

421
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,590
they don't have cars.

422
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,510
So they'll take public transportation

423
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,977
or their bikes and you
know, the counselors work

424
00:19:57,977 --> 00:20:01,527
with them, trying to get them
back on their feet basically

425
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:05,430
and become, you know,
productive members of society.

426
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,999
That's what this is all about.

427
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:07,832
- Robert.

428
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,113
- So all of your clientele
at the transition house,

429
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:15,588
they are going to be from
a rehabilitation center?

430
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:16,421
- Yes.

431
00:20:16,421 --> 00:20:19,510
- So you come out of
jail and you go into a.

432
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,343
- Halfway house.

433
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:21,537
- Halfway house and
then from halfway house,

434
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:25,270
you stay there so long and
you improve or you go back.

435
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:29,319
And if you improve then you
go to a transition house

436
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:32,172
and you can stay there,
promote yourself, get better,

437
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:34,528
but you go up the ladder like anyone else.

438
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:36,857
- That's my understanding. Yes.

439
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:38,173
- I'm going to state this for the record.

440
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:40,680
I don't see this as a conflict,

441
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,320
but I'm on the board of directors
of the Opportunity Center

442
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,553
which is almost adjacent, very near there.

443
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,660
So I have an interest in, you know,

444
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,610
this area, but I don't believe
that's any sort of conflict.

445
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,410
Okay. We'll take any public
comments at this time.

446
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,473
Would anyone from the public
like to make any comments?

447
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,870
No. More time.

448
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,340
Any public comments?

449
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,763
Okay. Any discussion from the board?

450
00:21:13,693 --> 00:21:15,930
If not, we'd accept any motions
regarding this agenda item?

451
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,939
- I'll make a motion to approve.

452
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:19,680
- We have a motion to approve from Robert.

453
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,154
Do we have a second?

454
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:21,989
- I'll second.

455
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,555
- We have a second from Diana.

456
00:21:23,555 --> 00:21:24,593
Discussion, board, any discussion?

457
00:21:26,855 --> 00:21:28,830
If not, all in favor, please say aye.

458
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,390
- Aye.
- Aye.

459
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,190
- Opposed, please say no.

460
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,640
Hearing none, motion carries.

461
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,210
Thank you.

462
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,080
Public hearings.

463
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,880
Six. Nothing there.

464
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,890
Seven, discussion?

465
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,130
Brenda, board, anything?

466
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,950
- I need to confirm but I
don't think we have any items

467
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,780
for the first meeting in August,

468
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,114
but I'll definitely send you all an email.

469
00:21:51,114 --> 00:21:56,114
I believe the next project
that we have is scripts

470
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,433
for August 16th, but I will confirm.

471
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,873
- All right.

472
00:22:02,873 --> 00:22:04,740
And here, chairman and board members.

473
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,180
Alex, welcome.

474
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,621
What's your last name, Alex?

475
00:22:07,621 --> 00:22:08,943
So I'm Alex Lanny.

476
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,841
Yes. Thank you.

477
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:16,841
- Welcome and thank you for being here.

478
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,780
- Yeah, resident of
Kissimmee, live downtown.

479
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,510
Excited to try to help
out the city, do my part

480
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,670
and yeah, cool.

481
00:22:29,106 --> 00:22:31,523
- Anything from our attorney?

482
00:22:33,272 --> 00:22:36,450
- I just, for you guys and for Alex also,

483
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:41,450
just to elaborate on one of
your questions having to do

484
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,443
with this site plan
that the conditional use

485
00:22:45,443 --> 00:22:50,443
of the site plan is, Christian
was mentioning when you asked

486
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,760
about the flood plains,
that's something that goes

487
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,350
at the next level of review.

488
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,410
So site plan is kind of a first stage

489
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,890
and it's kind of an overview
of the development project.

490
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,880
It's a rough draft and then it
goes into construction plans.

491
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,300
So that's where you would
see those details just to,

492
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,180
construction plans never
come back to this board.

493
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,023
So that's as in depth of a
rendering as you would see, so.

494
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,253
- I'll just say thank you

495
00:23:19,253 --> 00:23:22,010
to everyone who showed
up to take an interest

496
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,300
in what goes on here in your city.

497
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,170
Thank you for that.

498
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,547
Thank you.

499
00:23:26,547 --> 00:23:28,268
Do we have a motion to adjourn?

500
00:23:28,268 --> 00:23:29,550
- I'll make a motion to adjourn.

501
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,650
- Robert, motion to adjourn.

502
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,483
Second?

503
00:23:32,483 --> 00:23:33,316
- Second.

504
00:23:33,316 --> 00:23:35,490
- Second, Alex, any discussion?

505
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,650
If not all in favor, please say aye.

506
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,940
Aye.

507
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,500
Opposed, please say no.

508
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,150
Meaning adjourned at 6:24.

509
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:42,983
Thank you.
