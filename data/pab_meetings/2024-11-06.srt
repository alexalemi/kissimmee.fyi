And I'll turn over to Christian and Ryan.

193
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,043
- Good evening.

194
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,953
My name is Christian Arias.

195
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,230
I am a senior planner currently
holding a senior planner

196
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,880
title with the supervisory role

197
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,010
here at the city of Kissimmee.

198
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,597
Have been here for two years on and off

199
00:09:04,597 --> 00:09:09,250
and I say on and off
because I took six months

200
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,890
in the private world,
the land planning manager

201
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,190
for a major home builder,

202
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,990
but came back to the city
because government is my calling.

203
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,360
I like the government work that we do

204
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,720
and I have more experience,
I feel more comfortable

205
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,030
and it's really, to be honest with you,

206
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:34,080
my passion to be within the,

207
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,303
what I do and what we do every day,

208
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:40,840
and the team that we have.

209
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,060
I hold 15 years of urban
planning experience

210
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,020
with three years in the public
sector as a project manager

211
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,640
and the rest of 12 years

212
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,480
in intergovernmental and urban planning.

213
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,963
I started my career in city
of Lakewood, California.

214
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,070
From there I moved to project management,

215
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,030
then moved back

216
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,470
to the city of St.
Petersburg as a city planner.

217
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,750
Got a great opportunity
for the city of Mexico

218
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,580
in a large telecom industry
for a project manager.

219
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,350
Two years there.

220
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,350
Came back as a senior planner after that

221
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,370
and then incorporated
myself with Kissimmee

222
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,920
as a senior planner as well.

223
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,950
My education consists of a master's degree

224
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,360
from Universidad Autónoma del
Estado de Morelos in Mexico.

225
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,483
This with an emphasis
in territorial studies.

226
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,930
I also hold a bachelor's degree
in Urban Original Planning

227
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,720
from Cal Poly Pomona,
California State Polytechnic,

228
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,763
University of Pomona.

229
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,650
And my experience is normally dealing

230
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,120
with large scale projects,
annexations, land use amendments,

231
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,320
everything that you guys see

232
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,540
and we bring the applications before you,

233
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,260
but mostly the large scale,
more complex projects,

234
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,060
project management as well,

235
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,523
problem solving with our citizens.

236
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,700
So that's my range of
experience and expertise.

237
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,170
Interpretation of Land Development Code,

238
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:18,030
comprehensive plans, state
statutes, land development,

239
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,540
the land use, that's
where my strong points

240
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,810
and customer service,
since I've been working

241
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,780
since I was I think 16 years
old in customer service.

242
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,500
So I feel really comfortable
being there for our public

243
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,040
and our community and serve
them in any way possible we can.

244
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,570
So that's my experience.

245
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,403
Thank you.

246
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,780
- Hello all, I'm Ryan Altizer.

247
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,543
I'm planner two here at
the city of Kissimmee.

248
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,560
I got my bachelor's in
Environmental Studies

249
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,590
from Florida Gulf Coast
University with a minor

250
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:56,820
in history, theater and
interdisciplinary studies.

251
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,940
After that I moved to Chicago to do improv

252
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,350
for about 10 years.

253
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,960
I was a regional manager
for a smoothie company.

254
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,910
I have a diploma from Second City

255
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,713
for their musical conservatory.

256
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,830
And then I got my master's

257
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,660
at the University of Illinois in Chicago

258
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,640
in a Master's of Urban Planning and Policy

259
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,060
with a concentration in
Environmental Policy.

260
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,120
And from there I spent a year working

261
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,530
with a private landscape architect firm.

262
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,320
Then was a planner with
the city of Fort Pierce

263
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,420
where I moved up to senior planner.

264
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,730
I was there for about two and a half years

265
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,980
and then I came to Kissimmee.

266
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,053
So that's my experience in my education.

267
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:49,500
- Now I wanted for her to
describe her own experience,

268
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,450
but she's not gonna get away.

269
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:55,350
Ms. Kayla Smith here is
our recording secretary.

270
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,990
She is a small business
owner with experience

271
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,420
assisting other business owners navigate

272
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,640
through the local government process.

273
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,870
She has a bachelor's degree

274
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,440
from Florida Gulf Coast
University in Criminal Justice

275
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,890
and with a minor in psychology.

276
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,080
So the reason why I wanna do this again,

277
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,673
to introduce the staff,

278
00:13:14,673 --> 00:13:17,250
with the level of not only experience

279
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,340
but also expertise that you have here.

280
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,150
I don't work in the bubble
in no way, shape or form,

281
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,393
but this is the staff that
you have here supporting you.

282
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,083
- Should we introduce
ourselves and our background?

283
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,222
- I guess we're gonna move left to right.

284
00:13:47,222 --> 00:13:51,000
I just want to say thank you
guys for all your service.

285
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,130
I don't think you guys
have enough experience.

286
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,650
Maybe we need a little bit
more, I'm just playing.

287
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,913
I'm just playing.

288
00:13:56,913 --> 00:13:58,380
Just playing.

289
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,330
That's a lot of experience
behind you guys.

290
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,073
So that's kudos to you guys.

291
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,163
My name is Aaron Sabino,

292
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,280
I went to the Ohio State University.

293
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,070
I dual majored in Computer Engineering

294
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,533
and in Financial Economics.

295
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,030
I started out working
for an avionics company

296
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,020
helping design their avionics.

297
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,540
They end up putting me
in their procurement

298
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,073
in contracts office.

299
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,640
Started doing contract management

300
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,390
with research and development

301
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,710
for different things for the government.

302
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,680
Then the government decided
to hire me directly.

303
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,140
I worked for the Department
of Defense for eight years

304
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,253
doing research and development contracts.

305
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,360
Brought me from DC to Orlando.

306
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,683
This is how I get here.

307
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,040
I was working at a research park.

308
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,400
I have been here supporting
soldier lethality

309
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,723
for about four years now,
and I have just went private.

310
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,410
while I'm going private,
I got a little bit bored.

311
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,830
I don't have nearly the
workload that I used to have.

312
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,817
So I got accepted into George Washington

313
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,510
and I'm currently in law school.

314
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:20,340
So that's where I'm at, doing it online.

315
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,200
- You're in law school?

316
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,250
- I am getting ready, preparing myself

317
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,470
so they accepted all of them.

318
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,923
Pardon?

319
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:33,330
- Good luck.
- I know I'm already

320
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,890
regretting it a little
bit, but I'm knees deep.

321
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,410
They've already accepted
a lot of my credits.

322
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:44,490
I'm level three certified in contracts,

323
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,733
so they accepted a lot
of my credits for that.

324
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,370
So I've been living in Kissimmee

325
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,830
as a resident for now four years.

326
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,640
I moved here from Lake Nona, I
didn't really like Lake Nona.

327
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,093
I felt like it was a one dimensional city.

328
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,213
It didn't have all of the
desirables that I was looking for.

329
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,320
The desirables I was looking for was,

330
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,290
I didn't want to be strictly car dependent

331
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,900
to get around to other cities.

332
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,990
For instance, I like the fact
that we have the train here.

333
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,780
It allows me to go indulge
into different activities

334
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,080
into Winter Park and downtown.

335
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,430
Also, I liked the fact

336
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:30,060
that when I requested the
comprehensive city plans

337
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,740
and seeing how they were
looking to make this a real city

338
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,800
in cohesiveness with the county's project

339
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,710
for Neo City, was my biggest attraction.

340
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,260
Ever since then I've been
trying to get involved

341
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,920
with the city to see how the progress,

342
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,560
we are coming to making this a more

343
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,960
less of a car-centric
city, and more of a bicycle

344
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,850
and walkable city, across
all the neighborhoods

345
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,180
to connect them and obviously

346
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:11,180
increase making this a
more attractive place

347
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,683
for tech companies.

348
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,510
Right now, they don't have
a lot of the economics here

349
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,043
to support that right now,

350
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,340
but hopefully it could
become more attractive

351
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,173
in that capacity.

352
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:27,240
So that tells you a
little bit about who I am

353
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,730
and it tells you a
reason why I decide to be

354
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:34,230
a part of the board and
a part of the initiatives

355
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,650
here in the city of Kissimmee.

356
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,483
I yield back.

357
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:47,490
- All right, my name is Bob Spalding.

358
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,530
Lived in Kissimee for 14 years,

359
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,813
proud to be part of a number one city.

360
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,550
I wanna thank the board

361
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:57,000
for the work they have
done and what they do.

362
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,760
They don't get enough
gratification for that,

363
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,820
but proud to be a board member.

364
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,090
And I'm just a plain old 80-year-old man

365
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,473
giving back to the city.

366
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,693
Very simple.

367
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,353
To you.

368
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:18,059
- Okay.

369
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,010
Hi everyone, my name is Yolanda Bernard.

370
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,690
I'm from Mexico.

371
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,020
I am very excited to be here with us.

372
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,880
So it's very important for
me here today community.

373
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,200
I am business owner, I have my nonprofit,

374
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,120
I love help to the community.

375
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,680
I think it's really important
that help to grow this city

376
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,563
because it's a problem?

377
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:46,803
Oh thank you, sorry.

378
00:18:46,803 --> 00:18:49,860
It's very important that I think so

379
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,800
help to the community to grow.

380
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,800
because Kissimme have
great opportunity to grow

381
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,703
and be different.

382
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,423
I have my business in downtown Kissimee,

383
00:19:03,423 --> 00:19:05,730
it's really important for me.

384
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,725
In fact all the cities,
all the countries come

385
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:11,913
to meet Kissimme.

386
00:19:11,913 --> 00:19:15,480
It's very important work together

387
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,000
and be possible this opportunity.

388
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,833
Thank you.

389
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,426
I want to help.

390
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,926
Thank you so much.

391
00:19:25,677 --> 00:19:27,813
- And hi, I'm Alex Lemming.

392
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,650
So I actually went to high
school in central Florida

393
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,570
in sort of East Orlando area.

394
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,190
Then kind of went off and did school,

395
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,230
did bachelor's in Physics

396
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,850
at California Institute of Technology

397
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,290
and then a master's and a PhD

398
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,740
in Theoretical Condensed
Matter Physics at Cornell.

399
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,000
Since then, I switched fields

400
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,430
to do machine learning and AI stuff.

401
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,260
I'm a senior research scientist

402
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,210
currently with Google DeepMind.

403
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,940
But I serve on the board

404
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,270
because I believe in civic engagement.

405
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,583
I think I wish we had more of it.

406
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:01,680
I similar to Aaron,

407
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,370
when we were looking for
a new house in the area,

408
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,910
me and my family, I looked
at various municipalities,

409
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,900
comprehensive plans

410
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,210
and I really liked what
I saw in Kissimme's.

411
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,130
I think it gives a really great vision

412
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,750
for how the city can grow.

413
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,690
I really like the level of
engagement I find in the city.

414
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,410
I went through the Kissimme
School of Government

415
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,110
and I think programs
like that are fantastic.

416
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,440
And yeah, so I'm also
here, I really wanna help.

417
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,210
I wanna help push the city
in the direction I think it,

418
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,460
you know, is already
sort of promised ahead

419
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,218
and make it an even better place

420
00:20:38,218 --> 00:20:42,060
and hope to make the board
a more effective body

421
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,123
at trying to make the city better.

422
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,213
Thank you.

423
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:56,190
- Okay, so one of the things
that I wanna start off on

424
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,910
is a lot of times we'll have agenda items,

425
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,470
but it's on the same project.

426
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,050
Like we'll have three
separate agenda items, right?

427
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,180
And it'll be on the exact same project.

428
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,110
You're probably wondering

429
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,960
why do we have three separate agenda items

430
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,583
on the same piece of property?

431
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,200
So there are different
aspects to the property.

432
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,240
There's different statutoric requirements

433
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,060
and different processes
that we have to go through.

434
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,360
There's different changes that
are happening on the property

435
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,920
that we have to separate it out.

436
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,030
We can't make one motion on
all the different changes.

437
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,240
So this is the opportunity
to break down the reason why

438
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,240
we have to have separate
items on an annexation,

439
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,700
separate item on the land use as a nation,

440
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,790
separate for zoning and
for conditional use.

441
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,620
I'd like to use this here

442
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,260
because on the bottom
we'll start off with,

443
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,690
and how I have it separated
out is to go through

444
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,700
each of the different
types of applications

445
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,710
that are presented to you as a board.

446
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,780
So it'll be annexations,

447
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,450
future land use, land use amendments.

448
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,010
Those are changes to the comp plan,

449
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,630
whether it be a map or tax.

450
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,393
We've got zoning and we
got conditional uses.

451
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,970
So the first one we're gonna start off is,

452
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,860
is a voluntary annexation.

453
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,870
So because we're a municipality,

454
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,840
that means it's typically
the annexation request

455
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,510
that we get, are gonna be a property owner

456
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,720
wishing they have initiated an application

457
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,130
to voluntarily join the
city of Kissimmee from,

458
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,430
and you hear unincorporated,
that means Osceola County.

459
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,860
So their property is
an unincorporated area

460
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,810
that's not within city limits

461
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,690
and they're requesting
now for their property

462
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,690
to be included into city limits.

463
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,760
So this goes into specifically

464
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,760
the Florida statutes 171.044
from the statutory requirement.

465
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,950
I've got a Land Development
Code cross section

466
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,890
that talks about the process.

467
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,630
Annexations as a whole,

468
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,083
it's probably the simplest
type of criteria that there is.

469
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,590
It has to be, the property
has to be contiguous,

470
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,620
like it says here, has to be
contiguous to city limits.

471
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,130
That's really the criteria that's there.

472
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,950
It has to be in some way on some side

473
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,870
or some boundary of that property

474
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,300
has to be contiguous to a property

475
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,490
that's already is in city limits.

476
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,070
So by way of criteria is the simplest

477
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,580
that the process is one of
the most complex processes

478
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,930
by way of public hearing.

479
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,620
It requires two separate
city commission meetings

480
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,830
after it's presented to you
at Planning Advisory Board.

481
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:35,070
But that's the essentially
what a voluntary annexation.

482
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,390
It's few and far between

483
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,610
that we have what we call an involuntary.

484
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,610
It's usually, typically
not something that we,

485
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,300
it's a forced annexation

486
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,060
and it requires a referendum
and what have you.

487
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,760
So most of the applications that you have

488
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,110
are gonna be voluntary.

489
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,030
A property owner wishing and requesting

490
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,683
and submitting an application.

491
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,770
The other one that we've had recently

492
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,230
is also if the city and the county

493
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,630
enters into an interlocal agreement,

494
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,680
because we had a mass annexation
via an interlocal agreement

495
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,680
with the county that annexed
256 properties back in 2019.

496
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,409
So there's other mechanisms,

497
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:18,120
it's a bit rare to have that.

498
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,800
But we have intergovernment coordination

499
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,590
where you can do annexations
via interlocal agreement.

500
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,720
There's involuntary, which we typically,

501
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,300
again, it's mostly gonna
be voluntary annexations

502
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,083
that you see Planning
Advisory Board agenda items.

503
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,290
The next one is gonna be
future land use changes.

504
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,380
This is going to be, so
the comprehensive plan,

505
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,180
I think the most of you are familiar

506
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,740
with the comprehensive plan.

507
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,870
I'll go into another slides a bit more.

508
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,670
But the applications that you're gonna see

509
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,930
are land use amendments.

510
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,370
There's two different types.

511
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,410
It's gonna be a map amendment,

512
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,600
meaning that that property is changing

513
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,840
the future land use
designation on their property,

514
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,420
which is the most common type

515
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,890
that you're gonna see before this board

516
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,300
is gonna be a map amendment.

517
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,220
So it's changing the colors

518
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,680
or the future land use
designation on the map.

519
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,480
The other types that's few and far between

520
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,610
is gonna be a text amendment.

521
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,380
That means changing the text

522
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,430
of a particular policy
in a different element.

523
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,740
We call the chapters an element.

524
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,290
Future land use element
is gonna be the one again

525
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,910
that you're primarily gonna be looking at.

526
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,460
But we have different elements
from different chapters.

527
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,150
A text is making a change to
a goal objective or policy.

528
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,680
Again, few and far between,

529
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,370
but it's gonna be, majority
of it's gonna be mapped.

530
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,040
Florida statutes, again,
will receive a copy of it.

531
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,240
If you wanna go into more detail

532
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,330
that 1633.3184 hasn't changed,

533
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,433
thank goodness for decades now.

534
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,870
But it just goes into the process

535
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,360
of what happens behind the scenes

536
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,050
after the application goes
before city commission

537
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:58,890
and it gets approved.

538
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,780
There's a lot of stuff that we have to do

539
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,360
as a local government, transmit
it back up to the state.

540
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,640
So that goes into that detail.

541
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,470
I put in there large because
if you talk to a planner,

542
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,450
it can tell you a lot
about their experience.

543
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,250
It used to be called a large scale.

544
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,420
We still look at it as
a large scale amendment.

545
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,543
Small scale is anything
less than 50 acres.

546
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,020
Those do not go through a
formal review by the state,

547
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,850
but we still transmit it to the state

548
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,510
just to make sure within
that, less than the 50 acres

549
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,450
with that got the LDC
code reference too as well

550
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,010
that you can also cross reference

551
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,603
in the Land Development Code.

552
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,580
Again, I don't wanna harp on this,

553
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,680
but this is, goes into
a little bit detail.

554
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,610
The difference between

555
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,100
what's an expedited and
what's a state review.

556
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,630
Again, this is really with staff.

557
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,750
We prepare a cover letter and we request,

558
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,540
Florida commerce is now
the, what do you call it?

559
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,750
State planning agency now
it's called Florida Commerce

560
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,460
that we send all this to.

561
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,680
And within our cover
letter we have to state

562
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,270
what type of review it is.

563
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,890
Expedited, it's going to be again,

564
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:08,430
small scale amendments,
which is usually gonna be

565
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,060
the most of the amendments that you have.

566
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,910
Hilliard Isle, the larger one,
again, if it's over 50 acres,

567
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,470
it's gonna put it into all comprehensive,

568
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,260
it's still gonna be the
expedited review, it's mostly.

569
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,790
The state ones are gonna be

570
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:27,300
when we do the evaluation
appraisal process.

571
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,590
But the majority of the ones

572
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,940
that you see are gonna
be the expedited review.

573
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,000
This goes into detail,

574
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,540
again, this is a future land use policy.

575
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,030
Again, the maps and the colors,

576
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,590
they're not just colors for us.

577
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,680
Again, the different colors
designate the different types

578
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,800
of future land use
designations on the map.

579
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,490
One of the things that we
look at is compatibility.

580
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:58,490
The future land use establishes
density and intensity

581
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,140
usually in floor area ratio.

582
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,810
And typically that's
how you want to keep it.

583
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,450
Just intensity and density

584
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:11,450
and overall broad general types of uses.

585
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,970
And I'll get a little bit
further into the implementation

586
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,650
and I wanna deep dive a bit more

587
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,657
into that comprehensive plan,

588
00:28:17,657 --> 00:28:20,820
'cause I know there's been
some past questions about it.

589
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,170
- So I'm sorry Brenda,
to go back at the slide.

590
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,680
I guess you're highlighting
some of the differences

591
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,413
between expedited and state level reviews.

592
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,740
Do those have different criteria

593
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,900
for consideration by the PAB

594
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,660
or those are primarily
no differences as far-

595
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,950
- No.
- As no staff is concerned?

596
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,100
- It's just a staff
transmittal type of yeah,

597
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,610
it's not any consideration,
it's more process.

598
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,443
- Gotcha.

599
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,910
- Okay.

600
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,900
So this one here, it talks
about the comprehensive plan

601
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,270
and providing the principal guidelines

602
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,540
and standards from Florida statutes.

603
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,980
I also wanted to,

604
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,100
the reason why I put a
underlying through it

605
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,360
is because the state land plan
agency has changed around.

606
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,320
I know different times

607
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,150
it was Department of Community Affairs,

608
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,640
then it was Department
of Economic Opportunity.

609
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,060
And I think only this past year in 2024,

610
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,840
it changed again to
Department of Commerce.

611
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,660
Nonetheless, whatever the iteration is,

612
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,760
it's the state land planning agency.

613
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,120
So calls out the Department of Commerce.

614
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,610
Also included the local planning agency

615
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:36,870
for the city of Kissimmee is
the Planning Advisory Board.

616
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:41,640
But I really want to point out
that it does not have to be

617
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,130
a separate advisory board.

618
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,500
It just could be the governing body

619
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,510
of each local government, what have you,

620
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,540
can establish a local planning agency.

621
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,933
And I'll go into a bit
more detail about that.

622
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,880
The first one here,
although it's not something

623
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,770
that you wanna really practice,

624
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,260
is that the governing
body, in this case here,

625
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,690
the governing body is
gonna be city commission

626
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:11,610
may designate its own self,
as the local planning agency.

627
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,660
I actually worked for a
city where the city council

628
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,960
was also the local planning agency.

629
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,960
So by practice it may not be,
but it is not against the law.

630
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,360
So it provides on here

631
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,900
that the governing body
may designate itself

632
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,940
as the local planning agency.

633
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,670
And even in the central
Florida, in my experience,

634
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,920
you do have the case where

635
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,940
a council or commission wears both hats.

636
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,980
- But sorry, I thought
you said that as far

637
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,880
as Kissimmee is concerned,
the Planning Advisory Board

638
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,930
is already designated as
the local planning agency?

639
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,139
- Correct.

640
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:54,720
But I'm just pointing out that statutorily

641
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,290
that the governing body could also serve

642
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,110
and function as the local planning agency.

643
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,337
Like each.

644
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:04,260
Let me, if you please,

645
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,380
I wanna try to get
through the slides first.

646
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,450
But I'm just emphasizing

647
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,940
that the city of Kissimmee has its own,

648
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,550
but it's not statutorily required to,

649
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,830
just pointing out just by reference.

650
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,590
The local planning agency.

651
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,090
- I'm sorry, I guess I don't understand.

652
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,390
So you're saying right
now in the city charter,

653
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,220
the Planning Advisory Board is designated

654
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,720
as the local planning agency.

655
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,730
In this case, you say that
the governing already may,

656
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,830
according to Florida
statute designate itself

657
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,600
as the local planning agency?

658
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,360
Is that happening right
now in Kissimmee or not?

659
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,070
- It's not, that's why I pointed out,

660
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:42,330
so for Kissimmee, we have
a Planning Advisory Board,

661
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:45,750
but the governing body
may designate itself

662
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,007
as a local planning agency.

663
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:49,200
- And here governing body
means the city commission.

664
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,370
- City commission.
- Gotcha.

665
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,420
- Yeah.

666
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,750
So the other thing that
I want to point out

667
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,530
in the second slide about
the local planning agency,

668
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:01,200
that in preparing the comprehensive plan.

669
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,830
But the agency can be a
local planning commission,

670
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,630
the planning department
or the local government

671
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,280
or other instrumentality.

672
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Again, the statutes provides
a lot of leeway of how to,

673
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,170
regarding oversight in
the comprehensive plan,

674
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,763
the preparation of it.

675
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,440
The other one is the format of
the principles and guidelines

676
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,630
of the comprehensive plan can be done

677
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,970
at the discretion of local government.

678
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,190
It's standard practice to have goals,

679
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,230
objectives, and policies.

680
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:36,230
But it could be guiding principles.

681
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,850
It does not have to be established

682
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,280
by goals, objectives or policies.

683
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,040
But it could be aspirational
principles, what have you.

684
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,167
But I think in standard
practice, in my experience,

685
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:48,420
and I think with other planners here,

686
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,090
that it's goals, objectives, and policies.

687
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:54,450
Again, just to point out statutorily,

688
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:58,473
city of Kissimmee compared
to statutory requirements.

689
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,630
And this one here also about the intent

690
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:11,400
of including different
policies, different programs.

691
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,233
But,

692
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:16,800
it's not the intent to include

693
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,800
implementation regulations
within the comprehensive plan.

694
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,520
It's just outlining
strategies, principles,

695
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,710
different types of things
that will be carried out

696
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,880
or emphasizing different programs.

697
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,340
The comprehensive plan is not intended

698
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,070
to be an implementing type,

699
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:42,150
it's to lay out the
different types of strategies

700
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,950
and plans and principles.

701
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:47,350
- So in your experience, I
guess what would be an example

702
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,443
of an implementing regulation there?

703
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,600
- Well, one,

704
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,530
in the case of if you have a
conditional use application,

705
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,790
I'll get to it.

706
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,430
And the conditional use
assumes the comp plan,

707
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:03,420
future land use and the
zoning is compatible.

708
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,800
But you are wanting to add
a condition of approval

709
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,130
to the conditional use based
on a policy and the comp plan.

710
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,920
You want to implement
it by adding the policy

711
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:18,150
as a condition, for example,
to the conditional use.

712
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,180
So by adding a condition
to a conditional use,

713
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:25,710
you're implementing that
by adding it as a condition

714
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,010
to a policy or something in the comp plan,

715
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:33,600
comprehensive plan as a
condition, if that makes sense.

716
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,940
Taking a policy, taking a goal,

717
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,610
taking an objective from the comp plan

718
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,890
and including it as a condition,

719
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,180
as part of the conditional use.

720
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,040
Now you're implementing it

721
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,410
and placing a condition
on the development.

722
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,150
That would be an example of that.

723
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,930
And that's not the intent
of, that's what it's saying,

724
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:54,390
it's not the intent to
be an implementation

725
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,460
using goals, objectives to implement.

726
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,922
It's just to establish
programs, services and goals.

727
00:35:00,922 --> 00:35:05,520
I also was thinking about
an example of a 5K race.

728
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,470
You plan on racing a 5K race
maybe in March or April or so,

729
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,630
and you set up goals, objectives,

730
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:17,370
and policies in place for
you to run this 5K race.

731
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,640
But there's other types of
factors that may come into play

732
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,640
that would require you to
postpone or to change that.

733
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,990
That's another example.

734
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,660
Like, you know, you set a goal in place

735
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,750
but you may not actually be able

736
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,730
to finish or reach that goal.

737
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:38,040
It might be another
alternative in its place.

738
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,240
That's how I'm,

739
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,960
unless there's some other
example that to find.

740
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,400
But.

741
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,530
- To help me understand, I guess.

742
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:48,750
So the first example you gave,

743
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:53,750
if we try to point to some
objective policy or goal

744
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,650
in the existing comprehensive plan

745
00:35:55,650 --> 00:36:00,450
and use it to try to create a condition

746
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,790
for some conditional use approval.

747
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,763
I guess the part I maybe
don't understand is,

748
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,110
anytime we approve any conditional use,

749
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,030
does that automatically get amended

750
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,110
to the comprehensive plan?

751
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,759
Is that part of the document?
- No, again, it's separate.

752
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:18,960
There's land use and zoning.

753
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,793
- So then I'm just,

754
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:21,510
I guess like could you help
me understand a little bit,

755
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,470
I'm trying to read the thing.

756
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,660
It says it's not the intent
to require the inclusion

757
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,110
of implementing regulations
in the comprehensive plan.

758
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,910
So the example you gave, like

759
00:36:37,264 --> 00:36:38,940
how does that constitute
an implementing regulation

760
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,240
in the comprehensive plan?

761
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,670
If we pointed to an objective policy

762
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,013
or goal in the comprehensive plan?

763
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,190
I guess the, okay, the first question.

764
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,780
I'm trying to learn these words, right?

765
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,810
So if I have a goal objective or policy

766
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,700
in the existing comprehensive plan,

767
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,060
could it be an implementing
regulation or is it sort of?

768
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,010
- It's not. No.
- No.

769
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:05,843
- No.

770
00:37:05,843 --> 00:37:08,460
- So now if, and similarly
if we have something

771
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,523
come before the board, which
is conditional use approval,

772
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,820
if we approve that,

773
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,270
that itself isn't part of
the comprehensive plan.

774
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,470
- No.

775
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:24,120
- So if we put a conditional
use or put a condition,

776
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,733
added a condition to a
conditional use application.

777
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,390
I guess I'm struggling to understand

778
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:33,000
how that would be an example
of an implementing regulation

779
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,140
in the comprehensive plan.

780
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,516
Because that is-
- It's not.

781
00:37:35,516 --> 00:37:36,349
- In the comprehensive plan.

782
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:37,650
- If you decide to add the condition

783
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:42,030
based on a comp plan policy,
you are free to add conditions,

784
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,410
you're free to modify.

785
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:47,100
But this is where staff will determine,

786
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,540
again, if it's a condition

787
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,250
based on the Land Development Code

788
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,560
or you know what have you,

789
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,460
it's if you add it based
on a comp plan goal

790
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,630
or objective policy.

791
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,470
- Gotcha.

792
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,000
I guess just taking a step back,

793
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,820
like reading this thing,
the kind of reading,

794
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,220
just like the English
words, the takeaway I get

795
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,250
is that the comprehensive
plan should try to stay

796
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,980
sort of aspirational
and shouldn't, you know,

797
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,350
deep dive into the details.

798
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,270
Is that kind of a good read of.

799
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,490
- Yes.
- Yes. Okay.

800
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,603
- Yes.
- Gotcha.

801
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,380
- The other aspect of
the comprehensive plan

802
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,170
is that it can reference
additional documents.

803
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,090
This is where it's so important.

804
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:33,480
So you've got goals,
objectives, and policies

805
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,420
and they also can
reference other documents.

806
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,890
So case in point here,

807
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,730
I added the example of policy 1.2.92

808
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,370
that references to the downtown CRA plan.

809
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:48,510
We didn't incorporate it into
there, but it's referenced.

810
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:51,540
So this is an example of
that in Florida statutes

811
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,360
where we have references to other plans

812
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,833
and other documents too.

813
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:00,333
- And to clarify, I
guess you're saying that

814
00:39:01,538 --> 00:39:05,040
163 3177 1B is saying that

815
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,190
if that reference to the
downtown CRA plan doesn't mean

816
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:11,940
that the downtown CRA plan is
part of the comprehensive plan

817
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,000
for the consideration of the
rest of Florida statutes?

818
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,573
- It's by reference.

819
00:39:16,573 --> 00:39:18,900
A local government can
include other documents

820
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,540
by reference but not incorporated into it.

821
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,070
- Yeah, and then I guess I'm wondering,

822
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,550
let's say there's an objective
in the downtown CRA plan,

823
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,980
if we are in trying to evaluate

824
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,333
the things done before the
board, can we, you know,

825
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,855
point to something in
the downtown CRA plan

826
00:39:36,855 --> 00:39:40,350
or the Vine Street CRA plan as a reason

827
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:45,350
for supporting our approval
or disapproval of the item?

828
00:39:48,238 --> 00:39:50,812
- I think the answer is yes.

829
00:39:50,812 --> 00:39:51,765
- Okay.
- Yeah.

830
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:52,773
- Gotcha. So.

831
00:39:52,773 --> 00:39:55,356
- And also just as an overview,

832
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,490
so the idea of the comprehensive plan,

833
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,220
it's the constitution,

834
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:07,220
the Land Development
Code or the, you know,

835
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,393
statutes, right?

836
00:40:11,249 --> 00:40:15,177
It's like the comp plan
is this broad, big thing

837
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:20,010
and the laws executed from that

838
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:22,950
are Land Development Code.

839
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,100
Sorry, Brenda.
- Yeah.

840
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,640
Thank you.

841
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,129
So yeah, I guess before,

842
00:40:29,129 --> 00:40:30,660
'cause it might help me
just to make sure I have,

843
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,940
again, I really like to be effective,

844
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,200
I'd like to make sure I understand

845
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,790
and this is like our opportunity now

846
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,230
to kind of get into it, right?

847
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:41,343
So yes, my understanding in
looking at the city charter,

848
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,250
like maybe just take a step back,

849
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,350
like what's the point of the PAB?

850
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,310
Like what's the role?

851
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,270
Like what's our duty?

852
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,380
Right?

853
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,230
And I guess first I like, okay,

854
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,900
this is what I got from
reading the charter.

855
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,450
What I got is that the PAB exists

856
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:01,260
to act as a citizen advisory
board to the city commission

857
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,010
who is meant to

858
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,000
primarily refer to and
try to make our decisions

859
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,483
based almost entirely on
the comprehensive plan.

860
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,860
And so then my interpretation is,

861
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,840
probably like the reason we exist

862
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,863
is to act as a sort of check
or balance in the sense that,

863
00:41:22,863 --> 00:41:24,480
you know, the comprehensive
plan is meant to be

864
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,270
a forward looking document
for the future of the city.

865
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:31,080
I can understand how
it'd be easy to kind of,

866
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,567
you know, lose sight of that
in the details or something.

867
00:41:33,567 --> 00:41:36,630
And so it feels like working
in our best capacity,

868
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,000
our job should be to try to like,

869
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,670
you know, add an additional pressure

870
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,030
or an additional focus to
make sure that day to day

871
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,160
the decisions being made
are kind of in keeping

872
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,100
with the vision of the comprehensive plan.

873
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,659
Is that you think a fair?

874
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:54,495
- But it's not just
the comprehensive plan.

875
00:41:54,495 --> 00:41:56,970
- And I understand that the
city has lots of other things

876
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:00,060
that they kind of are responsible to,

877
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,210
but I guess yeah, as far
as the board is concerned,

878
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,600
is it our...

879
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:09,900
It feels like the comprehensive plan

880
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,610
is meant to be sort of paramount

881
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,594
in our decision making
processes as a board.

882
00:42:14,594 --> 00:42:17,193
- Just, yes.

883
00:42:18,127 --> 00:42:21,270
- Okay.
- But it's not the only thing.

884
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,103
- Gotcha.

885
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:25,740
- It's not the only thing for the role.

886
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,460
Again, with an annexation,
we have policies about it,

887
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,280
but again, there's.

888
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,550
And rezoning, rezoning is
a change to the zoning map

889
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,470
that's not in the comprehensive plan.

890
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,020
- But I guess the
comprehensive plan does include

891
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,970
objectives, policies, and.

892
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,350
- Just just to be clear,

893
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:50,550
so Florida statutes requires establishment

894
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:55,550
of a land planning agency within, right,

895
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,543
so that's you guys.

896
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:03,770
And your mandate is comp plan.

897
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,380
But because the comp plan is the broader,

898
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,780
part of that is also
how do you execute it?

899
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,968
And that's in the details.
- Yeah.

900
00:43:17,968 --> 00:43:19,635
- So that's the LDC.

901
00:43:20,505 --> 00:43:22,050
- Gotcha.
- If that makes sense.

902
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,543
- Yeah, I think that helps.

903
00:43:26,067 --> 00:43:28,230
Okay. And then what I'm getting
out of these couple slides

904
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,080
is yeah, as far as Kissimmee is concerned

905
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,780
and as far as the rest of
Florida statutes are concerned,

906
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,753
we are the local planning agency,

907
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:40,020
the comprehensive plan,
the first point here

908
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:44,310
is meant to be aspirational
and not sort of detailed

909
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:47,010
in implementing specific regulations.

910
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:51,080
And the second point here
suggests that the downtown CRA

911
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,100
or the Vine Street, CRA,
these other documents

912
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,600
that are referenced in the comp plan

913
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,140
as far as we're concerned,
are in the comp plan

914
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,040
for Yeah. Gotcha.

915
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,660
- Mr. Fallon, did you have a question?

916
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,760
I didn't know you had, you were...

917
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,260
If you had a question or something.

918
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,070
Oh, okay.

919
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,440
- I just had my mic on.

920
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,273
So you might have heard,

921
00:44:14,273 --> 00:44:18,480
but I was kind of in the same situation.

922
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,340
I was thinking that the comp
plan as you guys refer to

923
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,010
is the umbrella, right?

924
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,140
And there's things that
fall underneath it,

925
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,810
like the CRA where it's referenced,

926
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:33,840
and it's kind of this one
big comprehensive plan.

927
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,670
And you're saying that there's others

928
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:36,810
that fall outside of that,

929
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:40,673
would be what we're also
including into that,

930
00:44:40,673 --> 00:44:43,890
that we need to be kind of cognizant on

931
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,930
that I may not be aware of.

932
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:49,140
So is there something,
some additional literature

933
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,200
that we need to kind of be informed on

934
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,930
so that we can make educated decisions

935
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:56,280
when we're here on this?

936
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,233
No, there isn't. Okay.

937
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,360
- Land Development Code,

938
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,990
but Land Development
Code, that's the zoning,

939
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,410
the planning, the zoning element of it.

940
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:10,110
- And also just to clarify,

941
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:15,110
so the relationship between the CRA plan

942
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,100
and the comprehensive
plan is a little murky.

943
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,563
So it doesn't always,

944
00:45:24,506 --> 00:45:27,190
it it is not a perfect umbrella.

945
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:32,987
Sometimes it's better to think

946
00:45:32,987 --> 00:45:36,960
of the CRA plan as independent,

947
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,960
although it is still consumed
by the comprehensive plan.

948
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,330
- Right, I think of it the CRA

949
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:50,310
and a comprehensive plan
as a overlap in some areas,

950
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:51,960
and then the comprehensive plan

951
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,030
is kind of much broader and bigger.

952
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,440
But the CRA district is kind of like

953
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,340
a small little area here, like.

954
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,173
- But it gets its own-

955
00:46:00,173 --> 00:46:02,910
- But the comprehensive
plan is much bigger.

956
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:07,050
- Right, but the CRA
gets its own master plan.

957
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,300
- And board.
- Like within,

958
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,740
so it's like that, CRA plan within it

959
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,343
and then from there Land Development Code.

960
00:46:18,966 --> 00:46:20,907
- Okay.

961
00:46:20,907 --> 00:46:22,800
- Does the CRA have its own

962
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,130
or could it have its own
Local planning agency?

963
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,654
- It has its own CRA board.

964
00:46:27,654 --> 00:46:30,623
So our city commission
acts as the CRA board.

965
00:46:30,623 --> 00:46:34,380
- And they are the local
planning agency for the CRA?

966
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,250
- Correct.

967
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,153
- Correct, okay.

968
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,300
- So in this case, the city,

969
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,920
remember that one slide I talked about,

970
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,210
I know this is planning but
the governing body is the CRA.

971
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:48,720
So we practice that
some other jurisdictions

972
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,850
as a separate CRA board.

973
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,040
But for the city and
I think Osceola County

974
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,530
for the West 192, for the longest time

975
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:59,220
the West 192 CRA was the
county commission too.

976
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,640
So city commission wears
the both hats in that case,

977
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,840
and that's an an option.

978
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,720
It could be together or
it could be separate.

979
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,900
Here for the planning,
it's separate other areas,

980
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,330
the city commission or city
council can also function

981
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,133
as local planning agency.

982
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:16,320
- And that's just to check,

983
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,030
that's also true for the Vine Street CRA

984
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,280
the commission is the Local Planning.

985
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,480
- Yeah.
- Yes.

986
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,763
- They also function as the CRA board.

987
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:31,283
Okay.

988
00:47:31,283 --> 00:47:35,220
So this talks about all
of the data analysis

989
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:39,360
and how we go about shaping
the goals and vision

990
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,560
and it talks about data.

991
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,200
'Cause I think there are some
questions that come up before.

992
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,630
I think what I wanna
point out with this one

993
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,993
is that to be based on the data,

994
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,040
means to react to it in an appropriate way

995
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,940
and to the extent necessary
indicated by the data available

996
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,750
on that particular subject
at the time of adoption

997
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:04,440
of the plan or plan amendment at issue.

998
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:09,360
So the data, and you can probably
can come across that maybe

999
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,920
some of the data may be a
bit dated in the comp plan.

1000
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,650
But you have to understand
that the other objective

1001
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:20,760
for the comp plan is 10
and 20 year horizons.

1002
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,540
These are in keeping
with that broad nature,

1003
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:28,830
a lot of times you'll see
the 2036 comprehensive plan

1004
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,150
for other jurisdictions,

1005
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:34,290
because there are other
sections of statutes that says

1006
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:39,290
that you need to look at this
from a 10 and 20 year horizon.

1007
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,280
Very, very broad.

1008
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,330
So that's why it's sometimes
it also makes it very difficult

1009
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:49,440
when you're talking about project specific

1010
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,760
and trying to, another reason
why that is difficult to

1011
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,250
implement on a project specific level

1012
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,650
when you're talking about data

1013
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,990
that could be 10 and 20 years out

1014
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:05,190
and it's to react to it based on the data

1015
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:07,470
at the time of adoption too as well.

1016
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:10,743
So I just wanted to point
that out too as well.

1017
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,910
Supporting data can be
used to aid in termination,

1018
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,950
compliance and consistency.

1019
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:19,110
Again, this is again something

1020
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:22,680
for y'all to consider too from
a background from the data

1021
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,170
and those types of things.

1022
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:28,503
And it's also from
professionally accepted sources.

1023
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,020
With the bureau, I think now

1024
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,240
it's the Florida University of Florida

1025
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,770
for Population Estimates.

1026
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:38,160
It used to be BEBR, the
Bureau Economic Resource,

1027
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,400
but I think it's, I'm
not sure if it still is,

1028
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,920
but there's, it used to be BEBR

1029
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,590
for University of Florida
for the longest time,

1030
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:49,650
but there's certain standard
in the planning profession,

1031
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:52,680
acceptable types of data sources.

1032
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:57,680
Metro Plan is our Metropolitan
Planning Organization or MPO.

1033
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,060
They also are acceptable NPOs

1034
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:03,690
or local NPOs are
acceptable sources of data,

1035
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:08,130
census track data, the,
what do you call it?

1036
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,800
Census also too as well.

1037
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,390
But also keep in mind too,

1038
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:15,240
when you start to see some
of this stuff too as well,

1039
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,380
it's because it has to be

1040
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,840
from professionally accepted sources.

1041
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,420
Like we can't go out there as planners

1042
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,120
and do an inventory of something

1043
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,050
and then incorporate some of
that data into the comp plan.

1044
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,780
It has to be some professionally accepted

1045
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,150
types of sources that we have to use.

1046
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:36,450
So just to bear in mind
and to keep that in mind.

1047
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:40,800
10, 20 year broad horizons too as well.

1048
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,933
- But then I guess so but this point is,

1049
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:49,560
this is relevant for at time of adoption

1050
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,910
and amendment, right?

1051
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,980
So I guess this is saying like,

1052
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,940
you know, the city makes broad
changes to the comp plan,

1053
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,790
tries to adopt new sections
or policies or stuff.

1054
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,890
- Amendments.
- Yeah.

1055
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:02,892
- Yeah.

1056
00:51:02,892 --> 00:51:03,725
- And I guess those
amendments could include

1057
00:51:03,725 --> 00:51:06,750
even the amendments that we see regularly,

1058
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,820
like the land use amendments
and stuff like that?

1059
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,650
I mean most of those don't
incorporate data, right?

1060
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:11,630
That's the...

1061
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,820
- So Land Development
Code is gonna be separate.

1062
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,970
So it's gonna be like
a comp plan amendment,

1063
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:20,610
a text amendment, that would be the case.

1064
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:21,780
- Yeah.

1065
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,370
- But not land.

1066
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:25,470
Land Development Code would
be completely separate.

1067
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:29,073
That would be an amendment
to the Land Development Code.

1068
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:32,730
- So I guess, so what are
some examples of data?

1069
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,890
Like right now in our comp
plan we've got the maps

1070
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:36,420
of like quality of service,

1071
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,010
number of lanes, things like that.

1072
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:39,785
That's the kind of data
that he's referring to?

1073
00:51:39,785 --> 00:51:40,702
- So, FDOT,

1074
00:51:41,553 --> 00:51:43,710
so we need to incorporate,

1075
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:48,710
FDOT now has updated 2024
roadway classifications.

1076
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:53,143
They have turn lane traffic counts,

1077
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:56,550
they've updated their
roadway classifications.

1078
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,770
They've updated their level service

1079
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:03,120
for state roadways here
within the city of Kissimmee.

1080
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,630
An amendment would be to
incorporate in our maps

1081
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,340
the map series transportation element

1082
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:11,970
to update the maps figure
2.32 what have you,

1083
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:13,470
in the transportation element.

1084
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,240
That would be a form of a plan amendment,

1085
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,820
a text amendment to update the data.

1086
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:21,480
Update the roadway classifications
level service, that FDOT,

1087
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,450
which is a professionally
acceptable source.

1088
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:26,700
That would be an example of it.

1089
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,533
- Yeah.

1090
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,263
- But also just,

1091
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:38,160
we also have staff who
are long-term planners.

1092
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,270
So they work on constantly,

1093
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:47,270
you know, looking at our
comp plan and revising it.

1094
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:53,030
So that's something that
is constantly in the woods,

1095
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:59,280
but that's not like before us as a board

1096
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,280
we're looking at specific
amendments to the comp plan.

1097
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:05,940
- Yeah, I guess I'm just trying.

1098
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:10,860
- Which is always in a process
of evaluating and revising.

1099
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,190
- So are those defined under the mandatory

1100
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,960
elements of change?

1101
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,960
'Cause those are more changed
by FDOT as you stated, right?

1102
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:23,223
And then, which would
be considered optional?

1103
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:27,000
What would be considered
an optional element?

1104
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,140
Like something like we've had

1105
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,640
a major flooding or something like that.

1106
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,600
- Coastal, yeah.

1107
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,863
'Cause we're not a coastal element for us.

1108
00:53:32,863 --> 00:53:35,760
I mean, that's a bad example.

1109
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,400
Some people have hazard mitigation.

1110
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,020
I've seen some jurisdictions

1111
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:44,400
have a hazard mitigation
element, that would be optional.

1112
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,400
A mandatory land use transportation,

1113
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:54,690
intergovernmental parks and rec housing

1114
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:56,370
typically or mandatory.

1115
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:00,360
It actually in that section
lists down the required ones

1116
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,235
are typical but not optional.
- One would be

1117
00:54:02,235 --> 00:54:05,010
something much less than
they used to be by law.

1118
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,003
- Absolutely.

1119
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:11,362
What's the other one that just
got public rights element?

1120
00:54:11,362 --> 00:54:12,840
- Yeah. (laughs)

1121
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,730
- That was about two years ago

1122
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:18,000
now that's a mandatory public
property rights, sorry,

1123
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,633
property rights element that
has some public participation.

1124
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:26,070
So property rights, yes,
Florida state of Florida.

1125
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,920
Very, very, very, very property rights,

1126
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,053
very have property rights state.

1127
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,600
But now it's mandatory
property rights element.

1128
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,750
These are some other resources.

1129
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:43,740
Florida Papers.

1130
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,970
I know that there were other,

1131
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:48,750
so there's a section that
says that we have to provide

1132
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:53,430
just the current adopted
elements or chapter

1133
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:54,270
of the comp plan.

1134
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:55,440
But I know that there are questions

1135
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,140
before about where to go to research.

1136
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,450
Previous iterations.

1137
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,190
This is at Florida Papers,

1138
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:04,200
so you just will plug
in city of Kissimmee,

1139
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,030
but this is where you can do some research

1140
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:11,030
on previous plan amendments,
whether it be small or large.

1141
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,380
This is where you can go to research,

1142
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,350
do all that research
called Florida Papers.

1143
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:17,183
- Yeah.

1144
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:19,290
- That Florida commerce,
that table comp contents

1145
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:21,660
goes through in detail flowcharts,

1146
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,130
it talks about how to process,

1147
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:25,350
again, this is more on the staff level,

1148
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:28,470
but I think there's some
really, really good information,

1149
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:31,110
particularly those statutory changes.

1150
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:34,350
It lists through all the
different changes going back to,

1151
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:35,183
I mean I don't think,

1152
00:55:35,183 --> 00:55:39,630
I think it's like 2011
or something like that.

1153
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:42,180
But it is a wealth of information

1154
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:45,600
about all the different changes there.

1155
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,310
But that is a wealth of information.

1156
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:51,300
But if you are interested
in about the process,

1157
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,900
again, all of this is
behind the scenes there,

1158
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,943
but is a wealth of information.

1159
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:02,730
- So I did notice that
the city, the new website,

1160
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,080
the comp plan is available

1161
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,243
on the website and thank
you for doing that.

1162
00:56:05,243 --> 00:56:06,693
I think that's great,

1163
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:08,760
If I had another request.

1164
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:13,320
Yeah, so going to like
the Florida Papers are,

1165
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:16,800
the bulk of our comp plan
is listed as an amendment

1166
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,660
as well as like the future
amendments and stuff.

1167
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,310
So it's kind of hard to navigate.

1168
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:21,660
And if we could do one more thing,

1169
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,700
it'd be nice to not only have the,

1170
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,410
you know, like the 800 page comp plan

1171
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:28,350
with the required sections
available on the website,

1172
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:31,200
but maybe a PDF with like
all of the amendments

1173
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,710
that we passed since that
2008 update available.

1174
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:36,960
- But that's where it's Florida Papers.

1175
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,290
- I know, but there's like
100 amendments in there,

1176
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:44,670
and since the comp plan was
adopted as an amendment,

1177
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:48,150
it took me kind of like
three hours to click through

1178
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:51,000
to try to find, you know, the start date

1179
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,380
and when it was adopted

1180
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,660
and try to track down all
the amendments and stuff.

1181
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,073
And it just,

1182
00:56:57,094 --> 00:56:59,430
the request would be like
every time we do an amendment,

1183
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:01,410
since we have a PDF
anyway, if we could just.

1184
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:04,110
- Right, but in preparing for this,

1185
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:06,480
I think there is a section
where we are required

1186
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,910
to have the latest and greatest.

1187
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:10,714
- Sorry, are required to have?

1188
00:57:10,714 --> 00:57:13,260
- We are required to
have available the latest

1189
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,390
and greatest in current comp plan.

1190
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,630
- And what I'm saying is the comp plan

1191
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:20,299
that's available on the website,

1192
00:57:20,299 --> 00:57:24,900
it was the, you know, 800 page amendment

1193
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,767
that was passed in 2008.

1194
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:30,090
And right now we're not making
available on our website,

1195
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:32,460
the amendments that
we've made to that since.

1196
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:36,510
- No, it includes when
we make an amendment

1197
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:40,500
that we had like for the
future land use element,

1198
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,997
which is one chapter of it,
that comp plan 800 pages,

1199
00:57:44,997 --> 00:57:49,997
is the latest and greatest for
the future land use element.

1200
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,770
It is the latest and greatest.

1201
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,410
- But like Hilliard Isle
wasn't in there, right?

1202
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:57,360
- Hilliard Isle.

1203
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,810
Again, you're talking
about the comp plan text,

1204
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,150
when we did it as a map.

1205
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,463
So the map would not be in that comp plan

1206
00:58:05,463 --> 00:58:09,177
when we did the Hilliard Isle
future land use amendment.

1207
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,240
- Yeah.

1208
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,510
And I understand that I can
find the Hilliard Isle map

1209
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:17,640
that the amendment that we passed

1210
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:20,370
associated with that at Florida Papers.

1211
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:21,900
But seeing is that as an amendment

1212
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,680
and is now part of the comprehensive plan,

1213
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,380
I think it would be
convenient if the city,

1214
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,880
when you click on the thing

1215
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,740
that says the current comprehensive plan,

1216
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:35,550
if that also included the amendments

1217
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,203
to that plan that we passed.

1218
00:58:38,752 --> 00:58:39,723
- I think that's probably an IT issue.

1219
00:58:43,438 --> 00:58:44,271
- Okay.

1220
00:58:45,367 --> 00:58:46,228
- But I think he's talking about that.

1221
00:58:46,228 --> 00:58:47,490
- Well I think he probably
needs to understand

1222
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:50,730
is when they upload it,
it's a conformed copy,

1223
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:53,340
so it's like they've already updated it

1224
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,780
and it's just references.

1225
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,190
This is the amended version

1226
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:58,680
and it's in its entirety with all changes

1227
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,303
inside that comprehensive plan.

1228
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,210
If you have all the additional amendments,

1229
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,370
then it's kind of like you need to have

1230
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:08,460
the base original plus all the amendments

1231
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:11,460
and it's kind of like separated out,

1232
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,410
and I think it'll cause more confusion.

1233
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:16,324
But the whole conformed copy as one,

1234
00:59:16,324 --> 00:59:18,870
kind of the one that was sent to me,

1235
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:22,260
it's not even on the
website, I had to request it.

1236
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:25,260
So, but as far as when I read it,

1237
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,570
I did see that it was an amended one,

1238
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:30,570
but it was the conformed version.

1239
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:34,890
- And yeah, I would love
for that to be the case

1240
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:36,450
that when you go to the city website

1241
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:38,880
and you click on the thing,
you get the conformed copy

1242
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,710
that is just the current
up-to-date version.

1243
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:41,543
- Correct.

1244
00:59:41,543 --> 00:59:42,840
- I guess I'm trying to communicate

1245
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,130
that last time I did that,

1246
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:45,570
I don't think that was the case.

1247
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:47,640
- I didn't even see, maybe
it's on the website, so.

1248
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,510
- No, yeah, it wasn't available.

1249
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:51,190
It is now in the new
updated Kissimmee website.

1250
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:52,023
- Okay.

1251
00:59:52,023 --> 00:59:53,880
- If you search for it,
there is a place to click

1252
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,290
and maybe we should just double check

1253
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:57,040
that when you click on that you get

1254
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,143
the totally updated version, so.

1255
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:03,660
- But I just wanna make sure I understand

1256
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,700
that the Hilliard Isle
was a map amendment.

1257
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,443
It wouldn't be in the comp plan.

1258
01:00:09,317 --> 01:00:11,610
- The wasn't an amendment
to the comprehensive plan?

1259
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:15,060
- It was a map, it wasn't a text.

1260
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:18,663
It didn't change any
text in the comp plan.

1261
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,840
- Okay.

1262
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,520
so now, okay, so now I
need to understand, right?

1263
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,720
- Mm-hmm.

1264
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,730
- In the Florida statute and on that slide

1265
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:28,590
we said that there were
two forms of amendments

1266
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:29,760
to the comprehensive plan.

1267
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,100
One is a map amendment and
one is a text amendment.

1268
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,390
- Correct.
- So when I hear that,

1269
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:35,070
I think that these are both amendments

1270
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:36,370
to the comprehensive plan.

1271
01:00:38,374 --> 01:00:40,440
And if they're both amendments
to the comprehensive plan,

1272
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,480
if you pass a map amendment,

1273
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,850
it seems like that should then be part

1274
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:46,980
of the comprehensive plan.

1275
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,803
- Not the map, map is separate.

1276
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:53,010
Because the map is separate.

1277
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:57,050
Because if we had to
incorporate map amendments

1278
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,050
in the comp plan,

1279
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:00,780
we would have to be
constantly updating the map.

1280
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:04,650
And I'm gonna tell you this
also from other prior experience

1281
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:08,310
also, it's gonna be standard
for other jurisdictions.

1282
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:11,583
The map amendments aren't
incorporated into the comp plan.

1283
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,200
- But then, if I hear you right,

1284
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:23,430
the only way to see the most
up-to-date version of the maps,

1285
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:28,083
the figures would be to go to
the Florida Papers website,

1286
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:33,120
and download and read
all of the amendments

1287
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,230
that have been passed.

1288
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:37,683
- And our GIS, we incorporate
into our GIS layer.

1289
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:42,483
- Good. Okay, good.

1290
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:45,750
- It's also.
- Go ahead. No, go ahead.

1291
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:49,443
- If you go to page 44,

1292
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,040
you have all the updated maps.

1293
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:57,330
You've got one, two, three,
four, four of those there.

1294
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:58,473
It's in the comp plan,

1295
01:02:02,655 --> 01:02:04,320
- The one available
right now you're saying

1296
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,090
and it has Hilliard Isle
dial and stuff on there.

1297
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,280
- Yeah.
- Okay, good. Awesome.

1298
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,880
Then it sounds like it's
been updated. That's great.

1299
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,830
Yes. Now the file has 2022 on it,

1300
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:24,093
so I think it's been updated.

1301
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,653
- Yep. Yep.

1302
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:34,950
So what we consider is compatibility

1303
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,170
adequate public services and facility.

1304
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,760
So sometimes in our staff report,

1305
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,170
some of the things that we look at,

1306
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:41,430
even for the map amendments,

1307
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:44,460
we look at compatibility on the map.

1308
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,810
If they wanna change the property

1309
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:48,900
wants to change future
land use designation,

1310
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,750
we need to see, well, is that
future land use designation

1311
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,730
within the immediate vicinity or the area?

1312
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:57,483
So is it compatible with
what's in the surrounding area?

1313
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,510
The other thing that
we look at too as well

1314
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:05,510
is adequate public services and
facilities level of service.

1315
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,380
I don't wanna get too
much into level of service

1316
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:11,800
because again, there's so
many preemptions and bills

1317
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:15,520
regarding with concurrency
that has changed

1318
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:19,020
what a local government can consider

1319
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,340
as far as what level of service

1320
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,260
and adequate public services,

1321
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:24,813
public services and
facilities and capacity.

1322
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:28,860
It's been chipped away of the public,

1323
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:32,040
the local government's
ability really quite frankly

1324
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:37,040
to require for developers to contribute

1325
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,500
to increasing a level of service,

1326
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:44,430
whether it be water, sewer, or roadway.

1327
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:47,700
So for example, if the
roadway is already failing,

1328
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:52,320
it's not on the developer
to try to totally eliminate

1329
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:56,100
and to improve the entire
segment of the roadway.

1330
01:03:56,100 --> 01:04:00,420
It's the developer to pay
his or her fair share of it

1331
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,890
based on their impact.

1332
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:05,670
So there's been a lot of
changes regarding concurrency,

1333
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:07,830
public services and facilities.

1334
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:11,550
In a nutshell, it allows for a developer

1335
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:13,830
to concurrently build

1336
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:17,280
and to construct the
improvements at the same time.

1337
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:22,280
And we cannot hold up or deny a project

1338
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:26,550
if there's not currently
adequate roadways,

1339
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:28,050
adequate utilities.

1340
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:30,390
It provides for them to improve it

1341
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:32,490
concurrently with construction.

1342
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:34,830
I think that's the biggest takeaway

1343
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:36,960
and that's the biggest change,

1344
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,470
where they are allowed to
complete their improvements,

1345
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:42,870
their fair share of the improvements

1346
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:45,720
concurrently with development
is the best takeaway

1347
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,980
that I can probably describe

1348
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,920
when it comes to adequate
public services and facilities.

1349
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,350
Mitigation of adverse impacts.

1350
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:56,130
So again, if there are
gonna be any types of,

1351
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:59,550
for example, impacts to a roadway,

1352
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:03,240
it may mean that they have
to expand the roadway,

1353
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,155
put in a turn lane.

1354
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:10,155
Expand the actual length of a turn signal,

1355
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:12,000
include a traffic signal.

1356
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,410
Those are the types of things

1357
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:15,750
that can be mitigate an adverse impact.

1358
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:19,710
And we can perhaps take
a look at to consider

1359
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:22,680
and of course again how it supports

1360
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,870
the goals, objectives, and policies.

1361
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:27,600
So on the findings and reasons,
when we do a staff report,

1362
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:31,470
we usually try to put a
blurb of a specific policy

1363
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:35,820
or specific section as
to how an application

1364
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:37,770
supports a specific goal, objective,

1365
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:40,020
or policy in our staff reports.

1366
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,870
Again here in my past experience,

1367
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:45,900
and they can probably
even attest to as well,

1368
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,883
for us, the city is pretty brief.

1369
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:52,170
Currently right now it's
not where we have to do

1370
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:54,240
four and five, six page staff reports

1371
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,370
where to go into detail.

1372
01:05:56,370 --> 01:06:01,230
So right now for us it's pretty
brief, concise to the point

1373
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:06,230
that's the spirit of the city
of Kissimmee to be clear,

1374
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,070
concise, direct, and to the point

1375
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:09,840
and not have to do, you know,

1376
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,720
or five or six just get to the point,

1377
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,500
and not have six and seven pages of things

1378
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,533
that people are probably not
gonna read or understand.

1379
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:28,050
Okay, so this goes into zoning.

1380
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:31,320
So in the state of Florida,

1381
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,750
because we are a
comprehensive planning state,

1382
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:37,980
this will apply to every
single property in the state.

1383
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:41,230
Every property has a
future land use designation

1384
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,910
and every property has
a zoning designation,

1385
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:46,380
it's two layers.

1386
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:48,600
So this is where we're moving away

1387
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,850
from the comprehensive plan,

1388
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:53,730
and now we're talking about the zoning.

1389
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:56,370
And the zoning, there
are standards in our,

1390
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:58,980
we talk about our Land Development Code.

1391
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:00,930
So within that Land Development Code,

1392
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:05,460
we have already established
zoning districts

1393
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,580
that are compatible with
the different land use

1394
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:09,990
designations that we have.

1395
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:12,090
It's already spelt out already.

1396
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:15,360
So the different types
of rezoning that we have

1397
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,680
that you are going to come across

1398
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,690
as a PUD, Plan Unit Development.

1399
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:21,900
This is a customized type of zoning

1400
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,170
where different development
standards can be customized

1401
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:26,850
and a developer and an
applicant can come in

1402
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:29,490
and create their own
standards that are different.

1403
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:32,250
We can have an amendment
to an existing PUD

1404
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:34,410
or we can have a rezoning
here in this example

1405
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:37,320
to change it from a
different zoning designation

1406
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,923
that's already established
in the Land Development Code.

1407
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:47,580
Again, this is where we start

1408
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:49,860
to mirror the comprehensive plan,

1409
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:53,160
this is the implementing document.

1410
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:56,490
The Land Development Code regulates,

1411
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:58,830
the Land Development Code establishes.

1412
01:07:58,830 --> 01:08:01,230
Now we get into pretty
much the nitty gritty.

1413
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:03,000
It establishes height,

1414
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,050
it establishes lot dimensions.

1415
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:09,123
It establishes landscaping,

1416
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:13,260
but it implements those broad categories.

1417
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,630
So it's broad goals and objectives

1418
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:16,260
of the comprehensive plan.

1419
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,840
It also establishes procedures, standards,

1420
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,770
even includes planning, advisory board

1421
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,723
and adopts and development
review process too as well.

1422
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:33,420
So those maps too as
well, there's standards.

1423
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:36,510
So this is from the American
Planning Association

1424
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:39,270
that the maps really,
there's the industry standard

1425
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:40,980
of different land use categories.

1426
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:43,290
So the colors mean something.

1427
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:45,420
So from someone for like Ryan coming down

1428
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:48,060
from Fort Pierce or even with Christian,

1429
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:51,450
usually residential is
some iteration of yellow.

1430
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:53,730
So there's some industry
colors and standards

1431
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:56,310
that we are familiar with too as well.

1432
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:58,140
Even the colors mean something.

1433
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:02,640
So even when we look at a
map, we can get an idea of,

1434
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,010
okay, yellow means that this
is a residential corridor.

1435
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:06,171
A residential area,

1436
01:09:06,171 --> 01:09:08,880
but I just wanna point
out that even the colors

1437
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,823
are pretty standard in
the urban planning world.

1438
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,770
Okay, this goes into the conditional uses.

1439
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:21,870
So we talked about zoning,

1440
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:24,450
and within the zoning
there's different uses.

1441
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:27,270
This is the A table that we have here

1442
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:30,720
and it points to the
different zoning categories.

1443
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,740
And where it says P,

1444
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:34,383
it means it's permitted,
it's allowable use.

1445
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:40,370
So when it has a P or permitted,
it's a particular use.

1446
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,300
That application is not gonna come

1447
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,040
before this Planning Advisory Board

1448
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,480
because it's a permitted use,

1449
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,997
it's an allowable use by the zoning,

1450
01:09:46,997 --> 01:09:50,460
and it does not require any
type of application or request

1451
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,650
to come before the
Planning Advisory Board.

1452
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:56,760
That particular use can
essentially complete it

1453
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,580
with our building permit
and maybe a business license

1454
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:02,820
with our building and
permitting department.

1455
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:05,160
But those types of uses
that speed, it's allowable.

1456
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:08,880
The ones that are C are the
ones where it could be allowed.

1457
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,230
And you're assuming, again,
the future land use designation

1458
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:16,050
and that zoning are
compatible with one another,

1459
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:19,980
but there's some type of use
or some type of intensity

1460
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:22,530
and potential of adverse impacts

1461
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:25,707
that requires a public hearing
and some considerations

1462
01:10:25,707 --> 01:10:29,100
and the potential for the
Planning Advisory Board

1463
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,253
to review and include
additional conditions.

1464
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:38,280
- And just to check basic question,

1465
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,840
the Land Development Code though,

1466
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,020
any amendments or modifications of that?

1467
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:45,271
That's the purview of the
city commission, right?

1468
01:10:45,271 --> 01:10:46,797
Not us.

1469
01:10:46,797 --> 01:10:49,140
- No. It actually will come before

1470
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:51,590
the Planning Advisory
Board for a recommendation.

1471
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:55,920
- Sorry if there's a
conditional use application

1472
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,090
that's gonna come before us,

1473
01:10:57,090 --> 01:11:02,090
but is it this body's
duty or who's responsible

1474
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:04,470
for amending the Land Development Code?

1475
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:06,090
Like if you're gonna add a change

1476
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:08,640
one of these Ps to a C or a C to a P.

1477
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,220
- It's primarily gonna be with staff,

1478
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:15,930
but we have had
applications from developers

1479
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:20,930
or property owners requesting
consideration of changes.

1480
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:25,560
And those are coordinated
through staff and analyzed.

1481
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,120
But typically it's going to be a staff

1482
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,780
that will initiate those.

1483
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:33,300
But we have inquiries
about, well, you know,

1484
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,400
city of St Cloud has, you know,

1485
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:40,110
this particular type of standard
and we'll do some research.

1486
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:43,890
We'll be directed to do some
research or what have you,

1487
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:45,930
to consider any type of potential changes.

1488
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:49,593
But it's going to be staff
ultimately has a discretion.

1489
01:11:50,549 --> 01:11:52,110
- I guess, sorry, to clarify,

1490
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:56,130
like you're saying staff
originates the suggestion,

1491
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:58,443
but like, I guess I'm
just like the legal arm.

1492
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:01,560
Can the Land Development Code be amended

1493
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,952
without any, you know, public
consideration or anything?

1494
01:12:04,952 --> 01:12:05,785
- No.
- No.

1495
01:12:05,785 --> 01:12:06,618
- No, right.

1496
01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:10,950
So who is it that approves
the amendment if there is one?

1497
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:12,720
- Ultimately it'd be City commission.

1498
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:13,680
- City commission.
- But it will go before

1499
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,720
this Planning Advisory
Board for a recommendation.

1500
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:16,830
- Oh, even a local,

1501
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:19,020
like a textual change to
the Land Development Code

1502
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:20,310
would first come here?

1503
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:21,713
- Yeah.
- Gotcha. Okay.

1504
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:25,253
Thank you.

1505
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:30,390
- Again, these are the different
types of conditional uses.

1506
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:32,100
Conditional uses is just that.

1507
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,140
We've had several of
'em that have come in.

1508
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,810
Typically it's just requesting the use.

1509
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:38,670
There's no site changes,

1510
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:40,950
there's no changes to the
exterior of the building.

1511
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:43,260
Typically it's gonna be
somebody that's coming in

1512
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,910
to the existing building

1513
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:47,820
and they want to change the
use inside the building.

1514
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:50,850
It doesn't require anything on the site.

1515
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:51,900
The second type is gonna be

1516
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,490
a conditional use with site plan.

1517
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:55,170
Either it's a vacant piece of property

1518
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:58,860
or they're adding or
modifying the site itself.

1519
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:01,980
And then the second category
is a conditional use

1520
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,210
with site improvements.

1521
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:05,190
That redevelopment plan is gonna indicate

1522
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:08,163
it's gonna be either in the
Vine Street or downtown CRA.

1523
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:17,340
Again, a lot of times
for the conditional uses

1524
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,920
you'll see that it will include,
this one here is an example

1525
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,930
of a condition use with the A site plan.

1526
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:25,710
So it's gonna be, this is
typically included in your packet

1527
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:27,780
that shows ultimately the building layout

1528
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:30,063
and some of the information on there.

1529
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:35,460
Again, there's certain
uses by way of the zoning

1530
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:36,630
that will require,

1531
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:39,450
again, public hearing,
public consideration.

1532
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:43,500
We've actually streamlined
a lot of those requirements

1533
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,080
from a couple years back.

1534
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,350
For example, Mr. Spalding,
I know you may remember

1535
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:51,570
that even outdoor storage at one point

1536
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:53,250
required a public hearing.

1537
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:57,660
And again, we did some further
analysis on outdoor storage

1538
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:01,230
and the city just implemented
overall across the board

1539
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:05,100
outdoor storage standards in
the Land Development Code.

1540
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,410
And it no longer requires a public hearing

1541
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:09,183
just to have outdoor storage.

1542
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,650
What was the other one?

1543
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:16,950
Outdoor storage was one I
think, I can't remember.

1544
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:19,620
There's something else too
as well that we used to...

1545
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:22,110
A landscape buffer waiver.

1546
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:25,653
Somebody wants to substitute
a wall for a fence,

1547
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,010
that used to come to
Planning Advisory Board.

1548
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:30,840
Again, we just established standards

1549
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,660
where now it goes before our committee.

1550
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:34,590
Just to streamline it,

1551
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:37,140
just from feedback from folks and stuff.

1552
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,910
So we've streamlined a lot of it.

1553
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:41,970
Again, conditional use is future land use

1554
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:45,150
and zoning designations are
compatible with one another.

1555
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:47,700
That's one of the things
that staff looks at.

1556
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,310
And it's just with the
conditional use approval,

1557
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:53,520
you'll see the additional
conditions of approval, added

1558
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,300
where you have the right to
modify and or add conditions

1559
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,310
to these types of applications.

1560
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:01,050
By the way, planning advisory board

1561
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:03,600
final approval for
conditional use applications,

1562
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,170
those types do not go
forward to city commission.

1563
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,920
So Planning Advisory
Board has authorization

1564
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,410
for final approval for conditional use.

1565
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:16,080
There is the appeal, I can't remember

1566
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,270
if it's city commission or circuit,

1567
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:20,730
but the Planning Advisory Board

1568
01:15:20,730 --> 01:15:23,190
and you have final authorization

1569
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:25,090
of final approval for conditional use.

1570
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:31,060
That's not so much recommendation
that it's final approval.

1571
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:34,733
All right.

1572
01:15:36,078 --> 01:15:39,180
I'd like to just kind of,
'cause it's like a lot here.

1573
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:41,850
So this is trivia here,

1574
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:42,900
Including Florida,

1575
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:47,130
how states have growth management programs

1576
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:48,570
that require strongly encourage

1577
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:50,433
the adoption of a comprehensive plan?

1578
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:56,160
Anyone, anyone, anyone?

1579
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,930
- I guess, D.

1580
01:15:57,930 --> 01:15:58,763
- D.

1581
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:01,983
Interestingly 13.

1582
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:06,090
So I included here the
different other types of states.

1583
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:07,890
What we'll have in my career too as well.

1584
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:10,740
You'll have planners to
come from different states.

1585
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:11,880
Again, they'll look for

1586
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:15,090
which other comprehensive planning states.

1587
01:16:15,090 --> 01:16:16,470
So I like to put it on here.

1588
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:18,930
Widely recognized growth
management that either require

1589
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:20,640
or strongly encourage the adoption

1590
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,960
of local comprehensive plans.

1591
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,510
So just a little bit of trivia.

1592
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:28,413
- So I guess I'd be curious
to hear from the experts,

1593
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:36,930
what are better in those 13 states

1594
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:38,830
and what are worse in those 13 states?

1595
01:16:44,274 --> 01:16:45,270
- What was question?

1596
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:48,090
- I mean like in your experience,

1597
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:51,000
13 of the 50 states require
comprehensive plans.

1598
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,240
I guess I'd just be curious to hear like,

1599
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:57,750
you know, your hot take for what that is

1600
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,190
sort of best at accomplishing

1601
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:03,483
and where it sort of most
gets in the way of planning.

1602
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:09,990
- I may just for my background
experience with California,

1603
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:11,503
for example, they have the,

1604
01:17:11,503 --> 01:17:15,030
a general plan, which is different
to the comprehensive plan

1605
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:17,460
and the general plan mostly over there,

1606
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:20,280
they have the seven elements required by,

1607
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,023
to adopt additional.

1608
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:27,750
I think you are experienced
or familiar with California.

1609
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:30,570
They have the California
Environmental Quality Act, CEQA

1610
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:33,210
and they have all internal components.

1611
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:35,070
So they have a general plan for,

1612
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:36,810
so for them it works perfectly.

1613
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:39,570
'cause there's a lot of
components attached to it.

1614
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:43,320
So what I've seen here, coming
from a different perspective,

1615
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,410
from all the way from the west to Florida,

1616
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:50,250
the comprehensive plan up
here, what I'm seeing is,

1617
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:55,250
it's working for what the
surrounding areas have.

1618
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:58,590
Here, for example, in
Florida we don't have a CEQA,

1619
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:01,020
we have it's NEQA,

1620
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:04,050
which is a National
Environmental Quality Act,

1621
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:08,520
which is secures the
environmental components of this.

1622
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,100
So it's normally,

1623
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:14,070
and if you can see here,
with the exception of Oregon,

1624
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:19,020
it's mostly done here on the
east side of the country.

1625
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:22,320
So, that's what I've seen in my experience

1626
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,780
where I've had the opportunity

1627
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:27,630
to grow as a professional in
California and then come here.

1628
01:18:27,630 --> 01:18:29,733
That's the different perspectives.

1629
01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:32,550
- Thank you.

1630
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:34,840
- I think a lot of it has to do with

1631
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:38,730
how it's regulated really.

1632
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:41,400
For the longest time, 1985,

1633
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:44,040
everyone knows here,
state of Florida, 1985,

1634
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,200
Pivotal Growth Management Act.

1635
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,750
A lot of people don't realize before 1985

1636
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:50,732
we had comprehensive plan requirements

1637
01:18:50,732 --> 01:18:54,330
that they just weren't implemented

1638
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:56,430
or they weren't really enforced.

1639
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:59,370
It was, again, strongly encouraged.

1640
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:00,960
So I think some of the pitfalls

1641
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,000
is that it's strongly encouraged

1642
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,640
where it's not here we have a transmittal,

1643
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,950
like we have to transmit to the state

1644
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:10,467
within 10 working days (laughs).

1645
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:14,589
- And let me tell you, I can say this.

1646
01:19:14,589 --> 01:19:16,330
- Go ahead.

1647
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:17,910
- It is one area

1648
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:22,060
where Florida has actually
been very progressive

1649
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:28,580
and the Growth Management Act was pretty,

1650
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,593
I think pretty,

1651
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:38,100
you know, trendsetting-
- Paradigm shift,

1652
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:38,933
I mean really.

1653
01:19:38,933 --> 01:19:43,200
- Yeah, I mean for a
state as large as Florida

1654
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:48,200
and mandating that for
the state and counties

1655
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,373
and municipalities.

1656
01:19:55,921 --> 01:19:59,370
I don't know the history
of the other states,

1657
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:04,370
but this is one area where I think Florida

1658
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:10,713
has historically done very well,

1659
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:15,483
from I think the planner perspective.

1660
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:21,565
The state has kind of eed out some of

1661
01:20:21,565 --> 01:20:26,250
what we would like to see
in our comprehensive plans.

1662
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:30,300
They have not made some of the things

1663
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:33,450
as mandatory as they had been.

1664
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:35,823
Concurrency is not what
it used to be, but,

1665
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,923
and those other states are much smaller.

1666
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:47,580
- It's been decimated really,

1667
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:52,260
and in my opinion that
that growth management act,

1668
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:54,300
and there's a lot of now go into it,

1669
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:58,800
these preemptions that come
down and they're unfunded.

1670
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,850
We don't get any additional
funding to regulate

1671
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:07,680
or to enforce these bills that
are coming from the state.

1672
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:10,800
In some cases, we are
not provided a direction.

1673
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,060
It's not clear.

1674
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:15,180
So we have to sort it out and
figure it out for ourselves

1675
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:19,170
how to interpret or how to implement.

1676
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:21,270
Do we need a comprehensive plan change?

1677
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:22,647
- Should I live local?

1678
01:21:22,647 --> 01:21:24,540
- I'll get some of that.

1679
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:27,240
- You know, do we need a
comprehensive planning state

1680
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,520
to be in compliance with this bill

1681
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,220
that just passed the legislation in 2024?

1682
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:35,340
Do we also need a Land
Development Code change,

1683
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:38,310
text amendment change to
the Land Development Code?

1684
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,690
Or is it just a process?

1685
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:40,920
Does the building department

1686
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,200
have to change a particular process?

1687
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,430
Do I have to implement

1688
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:47,160
another development
review committee process,

1689
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:50,550
or do we have to create
another application

1690
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:52,579
where it's just administrative?

1691
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:56,850
and it's all those things
that really, again, for us,

1692
01:21:56,850 --> 01:22:00,300
it's comprehensive plan is just one aspect

1693
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:03,333
of the stuff that we have to do.

1694
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:10,350
So the Planning Advisory Board,

1695
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:12,000
and just to let you know,

1696
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,160
I know you're taking the picture here.

1697
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,240
We'll send this to you

1698
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,500
'cause I'm sorry I was, you know,

1699
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,510
had to work on a couple of things.

1700
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:22,470
So we'll send this PowerPoint
to you and with the links.

1701
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:23,850
So the Planning Advisory Board

1702
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:27,723
is also the Brownfield Advisory
Committee for the city.

1703
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:30,450
We haven't had one come in.

1704
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:32,130
Now this does not mean

1705
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:36,900
that the Planning Advisory
Board reviews and comments,

1706
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:40,320
the actual remediation plans.

1707
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,090
There are some provisions in the statute

1708
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,650
that talks about compatibility.

1709
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:45,960
So it's similar to your you know,

1710
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:50,190
authorities and powers about
considering compatibility,

1711
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:54,810
considering the impacts
on neighboring properties.

1712
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:58,950
You or I don't have the
technical capability

1713
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:01,380
of going through a Brownfield plan.

1714
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,840
You probably know even bit
more on the Brownfield stuff

1715
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,620
to technical technicality
of a remediation plan.

1716
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,840
So your role as the committee is not that,

1717
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,320
but it's this consideration
of a redevelopment

1718
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:16,020
of a project within
the city's Brownfield's

1719
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,460
redevelopment area.

1720
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:21,030
But you are also, the
Planning Advisory Board

1721
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:22,500
is the Brownsville advisory Committee.

1722
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:25,590
I think we've convened only once or twice

1723
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:27,840
in the past five years

1724
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,970
as the Brownsville Advisory Committee.

1725
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:33,270
This was the Mosaic Apartments down here.

1726
01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:37,713
There was remediation
contamination on that site,

1727
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,130
and it was presented.

1728
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:44,610
A remediation plan was put into place

1729
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:46,470
and the board had to convene

1730
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:49,080
as the Brownfield advisory Committee.

1731
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:50,580
Any further questions on that?

1732
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:54,690
We worked closely with our
CRA team here with staff,

1733
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:57,240
but that was the last time
we had anything come in

1734
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,740
when we were building that mosaic

1735
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:01,770
because there was a
remediation Brownfield plan

1736
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:04,859
that had to be done and
had to be brought before.

1737
01:24:04,859 --> 01:24:07,563
- Can you kind of tell me
what a Brownfield area is?

1738
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:13,590
- It's areas that have
known type of contamination

1739
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:14,730
or, I take that,

1740
01:24:14,730 --> 01:24:18,750
it's not because the area
that we have designated,

1741
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:23,040
it's areas that have been
known to have contamination,

1742
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:26,310
but the Brownfield area map that we have

1743
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:29,790
also includes areas that
are adjacent to it as well.

1744
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:31,200
So just because a property

1745
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,750
is within that Brownfield area map

1746
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:37,830
does not mean it has any
type of contamination.

1747
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:39,860
It's adjacent to it.

1748
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:41,850
It makes it difficult for redevelopment,

1749
01:24:41,850 --> 01:24:44,310
even for properties that
are adjacent to that.

1750
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:46,004
But it's some type of,

1751
01:24:46,004 --> 01:24:49,710
that's why I have FDP, it's
some type of remediation

1752
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:53,970
or some type of area
that has had some type of

1753
01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:57,000
contaminations or
properties adjacent to it.

1754
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,400
So the city has established
a Brownfield area

1755
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:02,490
that includes properties again,
that are not contaminated,

1756
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:04,860
but are adjacent to it.

1757
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:06,570
That's the best way
that I can describe it.

1758
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:07,950
I don't know if any, you know,

1759
01:25:07,950 --> 01:25:10,084
as far as what brownfield areas.

1760
01:25:10,084 --> 01:25:14,610
- And I think also part of
designating those areas,

1761
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:19,350
it is helpful to get federal funding

1762
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:21,693
for any future development.

1763
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:25,440
- So yeah, just to try to
get basic understanding,

1764
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,270
make sure I get this,

1765
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:29,130
apparently there's like
federal money available

1766
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:30,750
for developing Brownfield area.

1767
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:32,670
Brownfield areas are defined to be areas

1768
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:35,190
that were contaminated
or polluted in some way,

1769
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:36,690
or adjacent properties.

1770
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:38,250
So if some developer comes in

1771
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:41,250
and they want to unlock some federal grant

1772
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:43,140
to try to help them to develop a property

1773
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:45,180
that has been designated as Brownfield,

1774
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:47,700
I guess we're gonna say, or some kind of,

1775
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:51,060
we have to look at it and approve it

1776
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:53,670
or what exactly is our role

1777
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:55,771
as the Brownfield Advisory Committee?

1778
01:25:55,771 --> 01:26:00,771
What actions or what
responsibilities do we have?

1779
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:02,760
- It's a, yeah, it's a committee.

1780
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,530
It's the same as an advisory committee.

1781
01:26:04,530 --> 01:26:06,540
A recommendation.

1782
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:09,270
Again, I think the last one is the plan

1783
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:12,930
that was for there is to making sure

1784
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:15,393
that it's compatibility.

1785
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:18,870
There's also some economic types

1786
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:20,640
of components to it as well.

1787
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:21,840
But there is a plan.

1788
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,043
There will be either a plan
or there will be some type of,

1789
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,800
I think it's like a grant

1790
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,683
or some type that will
become before the board.

1791
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:38,847
- And frankly, I'm not
sure how much Brownfield

1792
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:45,380
is even developable at this point, right?

1793
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:49,680
- Yeah, 'cause again,
Mosaic was the only one

1794
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,140
because that's where the
Hansel electrical plant

1795
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:53,943
was for decades.
- Right, right.

1796
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:58,590
- Back here, the Hansel power plants here.

1797
01:26:58,590 --> 01:26:59,523
So,

1798
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:05,010
this is in your capacity.
- Yeah.

1799
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:07,440
- I'm not sure that
this is something that,

1800
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,623
in your terms you will ever come to.

1801
01:27:11,550 --> 01:27:14,400
- I think it was once the last
five years was only one time.

1802
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,233
- Yeah.

1803
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:18,993
- But it's there.

1804
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:24,870
- So I also wanna point
out from the staff, again,

1805
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:27,450
this our staff
recommendations too as well.

1806
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:29,403
And some other considerations,

1807
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:34,830
again, as we help navigate different,

1808
01:27:34,830 --> 01:27:37,410
again, just knowing and understand,

1809
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:38,820
navigating through the comp plan,

1810
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:40,830
navigating through the
Land Development Code

1811
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:43,080
for statutes and processes.

1812
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:46,170
So there's rhyme or reason as to why

1813
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:49,683
our staff recommendations
are the way that they are.

1814
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:53,550
Other considerations
would be city policies

1815
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:55,620
and processes to as well.

1816
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:59,700
There's a level of
consistency regarding things.

1817
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:01,320
And not just even the applications,

1818
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:04,200
but again, advisory boards

1819
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,230
and our city clerk has her
Florida statute requirements

1820
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:10,140
of certain things and public notices

1821
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:15,140
and the due process for
applicants too as well.

1822
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:20,010
Moving projects forward in
a good faith effort for,

1823
01:28:20,010 --> 01:28:23,100
with the property owners and development.

1824
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:24,660
The other thing that I wanna
bring to your attention

1825
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:27,030
is a strategic plan too, as well.

1826
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:29,160
There might be in some cases,

1827
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:30,900
I know you mentioned about bike trails

1828
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:32,100
and different types of things,

1829
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:35,770
but the strategic plan
is also something that

1830
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:39,450
the city commission establishes annually

1831
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:41,160
at an annual retreat,

1832
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:44,430
that also provides city staff priorities.

1833
01:28:44,430 --> 01:28:47,100
There's high level types of priorities

1834
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:51,990
that may see as focusing on instead of,

1835
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:53,010
you know, bikeways and trails,

1836
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:54,780
it might be affordable housing.

1837
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:58,350
And so the city commission
wants to have staff

1838
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:02,430
put efforts and emphasis on
probably affordable housing.

1839
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:06,390
The next one might be an
effort on accessory dwelling.

1840
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:09,693
We did have this come up
that there was, you know,

1841
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,600
emphasis on accessory dwelling units,

1842
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,180
which was an offshoot
of affordable housing.

1843
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:19,770
So in some cases, that we have priorities

1844
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:24,770
where different goals and
objectives or policies

1845
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:28,290
that we might not give prime attention to

1846
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:30,510
because we have been directed

1847
01:29:30,510 --> 01:29:32,790
through the strategic
plan or other priorities

1848
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:35,280
or other direction from
the city commission

1849
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,660
to shift our focus.

1850
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:40,743
You have to remember that
we're trying to manage a city,

1851
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:45,210
and we have to be in service all thing,

1852
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:48,600
all types of citizens,
all types of businesses,

1853
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,610
all types of property owners.

1854
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:52,530
So each and every single one of us

1855
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:54,240
may have our different interests,

1856
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,450
but for us it's a juggling act

1857
01:29:57,450 --> 01:30:01,890
that we can't to some degree say no.

1858
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:04,440
You know, if a property owner has

1859
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,950
a dire, dire need about
noise or something,

1860
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:11,760
or another where we have
to shift our focus on

1861
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,840
that particular element.

1862
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,220
It could be schools.

1863
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:17,100
A couple years ago there
was an issue with schools

1864
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:20,850
and there was a legislative
bill that came into play about

1865
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:24,750
where we navigate to you,
hey, be careful if, you know,

1866
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:27,510
somebody says that I
don't want a development

1867
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:31,740
because the school is over capacity.

1868
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:35,130
Well, technically, you know,
we have to be careful about

1869
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:36,840
if you're denying an application

1870
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,853
because the school is over capacity.

1871
01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:44,010
That's, you know, we would try
to just delicately remind you

1872
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:48,810
that we're gonna be hard pressed
if you deny an application

1873
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:50,460
because the school is overcrowded.

1874
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:53,610
There's been some bills
and probably, you know,

1875
01:30:53,610 --> 01:30:57,750
case laws or those types
of things to be wary of.

1876
01:30:57,750 --> 01:31:00,225
We wanna be empathetic
to the public hearing

1877
01:31:00,225 --> 01:31:01,230
because it's the public forum.

1878
01:31:01,230 --> 01:31:02,940
But this is the rhyme or reason

1879
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:06,030
why the staff recommendations
are the way they are,

1880
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:08,220
because we are in the know,

1881
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:09,510
means as the certified planner,

1882
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:14,340
I'm required to take
certification, continuing education

1883
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:17,580
to stay involved in
innovative types of law,

1884
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:20,400
sustainability, same thing
with Calene2 as well.

1885
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:24,720
We're required to stay up to
date with different trends

1886
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:27,600
and different things to consider.

1887
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,830
But that strategic plan,
I'm anticipating it's also.

1888
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:34,590
- Can I just really quickly also,

1889
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:38,580
just before, and we've
talked about this before,

1890
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:41,553
but before anything comes here,

1891
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:47,570
first there's meetings, right?

1892
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:51,420
And then an application goes,

1893
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:53,530
there's a pre-application meeting

1894
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:58,290
for any development project,
pre-application meeting.

1895
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:01,323
Then from there it goes,

1896
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:05,100
a formal application is submitted,

1897
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:08,280
then it goes to development
review committee,

1898
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:13,280
which is open to the
public, and from there.

1899
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:18,480
And sometimes those
applications have to come back

1900
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,520
one or two times.

1901
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:25,520
And then eventually
some of them come here.

1902
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:31,113
So it is many months,
tons of work from staff.

1903
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,767
By the time it comes to you,

1904
01:32:33,767 --> 01:32:37,140
it has been looked at so many times

1905
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:39,213
by so many different eyes.

1906
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,950
So staff works very, very hard

1907
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:49,903
at making sure that by the
time these applications

1908
01:32:51,810 --> 01:32:56,810
come to you, to the board,
they've been very, very vetted.

1909
01:32:57,390 --> 01:33:01,200
And you know, it comes
to you for PAB board.

1910
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:06,200
But keep in mind that many departments,

1911
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:09,060
including the building department,

1912
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:10,953
public works and engineering,

1913
01:33:12,030 --> 01:33:16,740
fire, legal, everybody looks at it

1914
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:18,663
before it even comes to here.

1915
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:21,257
Sorry Brenda.

1916
01:33:22,470 --> 01:33:24,423
- No, absolutely.

1917
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:30,360
And I also wanna emphasize
also again with that,

1918
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:32,760
the expertise is what that due process.

1919
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:37,760
So we are well aware, again,
we are here to navigate

1920
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:42,090
and to make sure that there's a deep,

1921
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:45,120
we have multiple functions, okay?

1922
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,920
So one of 'em is, again, like I said,

1923
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:51,390
good faith effort to move
these, you know, development

1924
01:33:51,390 --> 01:33:53,190
folks have submitted an application.

1925
01:33:53,190 --> 01:33:54,720
So in a good faith effort,

1926
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:55,560
they've went through

1927
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:58,050
a development review
committee sometimes twice.

1928
01:33:58,050 --> 01:34:00,780
And now with that, they
are granted and afforded

1929
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:02,940
to move forward if they
have to move forward

1930
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:04,620
to the Planning Advisory Board.

1931
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:06,600
We have to provide advertisement,

1932
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,340
we have to have public notice,

1933
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:11,070
a minimum in advance of the meeting.

1934
01:34:11,070 --> 01:34:13,470
And so in some cases during
that committee meeting,

1935
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:16,380
and Kayla can attest, I'm
confirming right then and there,

1936
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:18,900
this is the Planning Advisory Board date

1937
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,163
that they're moving into.

1938
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:24,780
So at that point, there's
that level of expectation

1939
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:27,780
at that point that this is
gonna be this meeting here

1940
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:29,760
that will decide, determine,

1941
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,420
evaluate any types of
conditions or what have you.

1942
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:35,490
But when it moves
forward with that, again,

1943
01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:38,040
there's a good faith effort
if they have to move forward

1944
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:42,090
to city commission too, that
they've gone through the step,

1945
01:34:42,090 --> 01:34:45,270
they've gone through a PAB,
they've gone to city commission.

1946
01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:49,980
So that's what you just be
careful, and be mindful of that.

1947
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:52,980
Especially when you're, you know,

1948
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:54,360
projects and different things

1949
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:57,390
that they've gone through this process.

1950
01:34:57,390 --> 01:35:01,550
And we have a set schedule too

1951
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:04,170
of when they submit
applications anticipated

1952
01:35:04,170 --> 01:35:06,090
of when they're going to
the Planning Advisory Board

1953
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:07,350
and when they're gonna city commission.

1954
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:10,380
Now granted we have to confirm a quorum,

1955
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:14,520
but there's a a lot
involved, and to make sure

1956
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:18,690
that they've gone through
the necessary steps.

1957
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:20,280
Strategic plan governing body

1958
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:22,170
against city commission priorities

1959
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:27,090
can take away the staff's ability to say,

1960
01:35:27,090 --> 01:35:29,400
you know, in consideration
with the department director

1961
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:31,747
or even city manager, that
unfortunately right now,

1962
01:35:31,747 --> 01:35:35,340
you know, we can't focus on certain goals.

1963
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:39,060
We can't focus on actively,
again, these are aspirational.

1964
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:42,573
So there's a lot of aspects
that go into play with,

1965
01:35:43,806 --> 01:35:45,660
that you may feel that, you know,

1966
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:48,930
staff is not emphasizing a certain goal

1967
01:35:48,930 --> 01:35:53,490
or we're not emphasizing
a certain objective.

1968
01:35:53,490 --> 01:35:55,200
There's a lot to, that comes into play,

1969
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,940
and these are some of the types of things.

1970
01:35:56,940 --> 01:36:01,620
Last but certainly not least,
preemptions, preemptions.

1971
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:04,830
Bills, bills, bills,
preemptions, preemptions.

1972
01:36:04,830 --> 01:36:07,890
It is a planner's job really

1973
01:36:07,890 --> 01:36:11,250
every time the legislature convenes.

1974
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:13,890
I mean this was unprecedented too as well.

1975
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:16,920
There's things that come
down with legislative bills

1976
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:18,570
that takes away.

1977
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:20,973
This year is the live local amendments.

1978
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,090
Again, it's not a new act,

1979
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:26,220
but it was an amendment to live local

1980
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:28,440
for affordable housing.

1981
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:31,170
One of the changes is
for affordable housing,

1982
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:33,030
if they meet certain criteria,

1983
01:36:33,030 --> 01:36:35,370
they do not need a public hearing

1984
01:36:35,370 --> 01:36:37,653
to change land use or zoning.

1985
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:40,050
That's a preemption.

1986
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:41,280
So it doesn't matter.

1987
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:45,600
A particular property has
an industrial land use.

1988
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:46,980
They don't have to come in.

1989
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:50,730
If they're meeting the provisions
of that live local acts,

1990
01:36:50,730 --> 01:36:52,410
they don't need to come in

1991
01:36:52,410 --> 01:36:55,710
to submit a future land use application

1992
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:58,590
and they do not need a public hearing.

1993
01:36:58,590 --> 01:37:00,813
That's a preemption, that's a bill.

1994
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:08,973
So there's a lot of things
that come into play.

1995
01:37:10,536 --> 01:37:12,330
I'm trying to think of another example.

1996
01:37:12,330 --> 01:37:15,180
I think the capital improvement element.

1997
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:17,490
So we talked about a tax amendment change.

1998
01:37:17,490 --> 01:37:18,390
I was looking at this,

1999
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:21,300
I remember from my long
range planning days

2000
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:25,380
where the annual updates to
the capital improvements plan,

2001
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:28,320
I believe does no longer requires.

2002
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,850
I think they just need to transmit,

2003
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:32,550
I don't think it requires
a public hearing.

2004
01:37:32,550 --> 01:37:34,710
But typically the capital
improvement update

2005
01:37:34,710 --> 01:37:37,590
is the five year capital
improvements plan.

2006
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:39,930
Identifying certain capital
improvements, roadways,

2007
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:41,493
that type of thing, anyway,

2008
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:44,550
that it doesn't require a public hearing

2009
01:37:44,550 --> 01:37:45,990
for the annual update.

2010
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:47,550
That doesn't mean the text amendments,

2011
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:49,050
it's just an annual update

2012
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:51,570
identifying the certain projects now.

2013
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:53,250
So that's a preemption where

2014
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:56,370
that doesn't require public hearing,

2015
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:58,830
it just requires the
transmittal up to the state.

2016
01:37:58,830 --> 01:38:02,763
So there's other different
nuances too as well with it.

2017
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:10,140
I think just kind of reemphasizing

2018
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:12,000
the planner and our function.

2019
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,850
So the Planning Advisory Board
is one of many functions.

2020
01:38:14,850 --> 01:38:17,910
So we're kind of central to that.

2021
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:20,130
So our function, our commitment

2022
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:22,740
and our responsibility to
the community residents,

2023
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:25,620
business owners, the public at large.

2024
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:27,030
Then we have the other aspects

2025
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:30,600
to development related
businesses to as well,

2026
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,220
which is also community residents.

2027
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:33,750
'Cause some of you are property owners,

2028
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:35,550
but also residents within the city tax

2029
01:38:35,550 --> 01:38:36,780
paying both as a resident

2030
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:39,450
and also as a business
and property owners.

2031
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:41,940
The other one is also to government.

2032
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:45,450
Our elected officials,
our interdepartmental,

2033
01:38:45,450 --> 01:38:48,270
we have state and federal agencies too,

2034
01:38:48,270 --> 01:38:50,490
that we have to be held accountable to

2035
01:38:50,490 --> 01:38:53,070
in certain different requirements too.

2036
01:38:53,070 --> 01:38:54,750
So that just shows multiple functions

2037
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:55,710
and roles that we have,

2038
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:59,520
considerations in formalizing
our staff recommendations

2039
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,713
and our positions and our conditions.

2040
01:39:05,010 --> 01:39:08,100
This here also from the
American Planning Association.

2041
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:09,630
I don't even, I have it on here.

2042
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:13,200
The, I have to see if, I
think we have this copy here.

2043
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:15,600
So I'm gonna also forward it to y'all.

2044
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:19,560
It's a planner's dictionary
that I find very, very useful.

2045
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:22,080
It also incorporates
different types of definitions

2046
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:25,050
from different jurisdictions
for a planner's dictionary

2047
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:28,110
to help with some of the different terms

2048
01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:30,693
and different things that we talk about.

2049
01:39:32,610 --> 01:39:35,160
This is also for planning officials.

2050
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:37,600
These are some of the other resources

2051
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:40,470
that we have available Plan Medicine,

2052
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:42,030
about what is the planning commission

2053
01:39:42,030 --> 01:39:45,540
that I also like to share
with planning officials

2054
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:47,043
and Planning Advisory Boards.

2055
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:50,190
So many different resources.

2056
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:52,050
And then there's also
additional ones here,

2057
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:54,480
again, when I talk
about professional types

2058
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:58,260
of different acceptable
type of organizations,

2059
01:39:58,260 --> 01:39:59,550
these are the ones here.

2060
01:39:59,550 --> 01:40:04,550
ULI, CNU, ICMA, Plan Medicine are really,

2061
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:08,730
again, different types of methodology,

2062
01:40:08,730 --> 01:40:12,240
data industry types of
policies and resources.

2063
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,610
This is not all exhaustive, if you will,

2064
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:17,853
but these are some of
the primary larger ones.

2065
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:22,143
Last final trivia question.

2066
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:24,083
Which of these states

2067
01:40:24,083 --> 01:40:26,310
was the first to mandate
comprehensive planning?

2068
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:29,550
- California?

2069
01:40:29,550 --> 01:40:31,320
No, you're probably gonna say D, right?

2070
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:32,463
For California.

2071
01:40:33,722 --> 01:40:34,555
- I'm gonna go with Hawaii.

2072
01:40:34,555 --> 01:40:35,400
- This one was very surprising.

2073
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:36,330
- Sorry, what?

2074
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:37,703
- I'm gonna guess Hawaii.

2075
01:40:37,703 --> 01:40:40,380
- Ah, that is correct.

2076
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:42,500
If you really, that is correct.

2077
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,910
In 1961, if you really think about it

2078
01:40:44,910 --> 01:40:47,040
with the islands and conservation,

2079
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:50,310
but it was in 1961,
Hawaii was the first state

2080
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:52,170
to pass a growth management law,

2081
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:53,970
and divided states where it had

2082
01:40:53,970 --> 01:40:56,970
the urban agricultural and conservation.

2083
01:40:56,970 --> 01:40:58,353
So that is correct.

2084
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,620
With that, that concludes.

2085
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:07,080
I do wanna point out, 'cause
I think that was the other,

2086
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:11,430
the really quickly about the
staff recommendations again.

2087
01:41:11,430 --> 01:41:16,430
So, the Planning Advisory
Board recommendations,

2088
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:20,940
again, they don't supersede right?

2089
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:25,170
They don't supersede or modify
the staff recommendations,

2090
01:41:25,170 --> 01:41:28,683
they just move forward with that.

2091
01:41:29,970 --> 01:41:32,100
That's not to say that it can't change,

2092
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:36,090
but typically the Planning
Advisory Board recommendations

2093
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:38,430
are that, but it doesn't take the place

2094
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:40,230
of the staff recommendations.

2095
01:41:40,230 --> 01:41:42,840
I will say, and it hasn't
happened in a while,

2096
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:47,840
but it has happened here
where the city commission

2097
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:53,210
will be different from
the staff recommendation

2098
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,650
or Planning Advisory Board recommendation.

2099
01:41:55,650 --> 01:41:58,200
They have the utmost authority

2100
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:01,770
to even not even take
either into consideration.

2101
01:42:01,770 --> 01:42:05,610
I've had staff recommendations
what, overturned by that.

2102
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:09,120
We've had ones that were remanded back.

2103
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:11,610
We had one remanded back to
development review committee.

2104
01:42:11,610 --> 01:42:14,553
We had one remanded back
to Planning Advisory Board.

2105
01:42:15,749 --> 01:42:16,830
You just never know.

2106
01:42:16,830 --> 01:42:19,440
There's all different types of iterations

2107
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:22,080
and we've had all types of experiences

2108
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,000
where the city commission

2109
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,240
ultimately has the final
determination there.

2110
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:31,410
But it's just that, it's
a recommendation on there.

2111
01:42:31,410 --> 01:42:34,920
So this is the contact information.

2112
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:39,920
I would be remiss, I forgot
Ms. Hasley too as well.

2113
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:43,230
So Ms. Hasley has nearly
20, our planning technician,

2114
01:42:43,230 --> 01:42:46,650
she was our former recording
secretary about this on here.

2115
01:42:46,650 --> 01:42:48,390
She's got nearly 20 years experience

2116
01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:49,803
with the city of Kissimmee.

2117
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:56,420
And she is our little,
little diamond kind of,

2118
01:42:57,300 --> 01:42:59,580
you know, super, super diamond in a rough,

2119
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:03,060
super, super smart to as well,

2120
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:07,710
but she grew of our
business license queen.

2121
01:43:07,710 --> 01:43:08,543
Okay.

2122
01:43:08,543 --> 01:43:11,460
If you have any, you know,
things about business licenses,

2123
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:16,050
but typically to the process
now of doing alcohol reviews.

2124
01:43:16,050 --> 01:43:17,070
But I want y'all to know,

2125
01:43:17,070 --> 01:43:19,220
like we even do things
with alcohol review.

2126
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:22,860
Like we actually are
responsible to sign off

2127
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:27,573
on state applications,
require local zoning approval.

2128
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:31,470
Our section does alcohol reviews.

2129
01:43:31,470 --> 01:43:33,750
So, so many other different
aspects besides that,

2130
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:34,779
that we do.

2131
01:43:34,779 --> 01:43:38,613
We do alcohol reviews, business licenses,

2132
01:43:39,690 --> 01:43:40,772
what?

2133
01:43:40,772 --> 01:43:41,605
- Zoning.

2134
01:43:41,605 --> 01:43:44,673
- Zoning verification
types, special events,

2135
01:43:46,019 --> 01:43:49,350
pain management licenses too as well.

2136
01:43:49,350 --> 01:43:50,490
- So there's all different.
- And of course

2137
01:43:50,490 --> 01:43:52,770
there are things that go to DRC

2138
01:43:52,770 --> 01:43:56,430
that never come before you
guys, which are, you know,

2139
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:57,780
site plans.

2140
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:58,833
Plots.
- Yeah.

2141
01:44:00,172 --> 01:44:01,005
- Subdivision

2142
01:44:01,005 --> 01:44:03,171
- Subdivisions.
- Subdivision, yeah.

2143
01:44:03,171 --> 01:44:04,620
- Construction plans.

2144
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:07,050
- Construction plans, yep.

2145
01:44:07,050 --> 01:44:08,580
- Variances.

2146
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:12,720
We also deal with all types of
variances that are less 30%,

2147
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:15,510
10 to 30% variation variances

2148
01:44:15,510 --> 01:44:18,480
on different code standards also that go,

2149
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:20,340
to the development review committee.

2150
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:23,070
If they're up to 10%, Craig,
our department director

2151
01:44:23,070 --> 01:44:25,080
is administrative variance signs.

2152
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,693
I forgot, how can I
forget about sign permits?

2153
01:44:28,638 --> 01:44:29,471
Signed permits.
- It's amazing.

2154
01:44:29,471 --> 01:44:34,083
It's amazing they can
even go home at night.

2155
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:36,540
- No, I do, and-
- It's true.

2156
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:39,060
- Trust me, I sleep soundly.

2157
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:42,660
You do this and no serious,
you do this for so long,

2158
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:44,520
you have to learn how to separate.

2159
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:49,470
And I've lived and
breathed urban planning.

2160
01:44:49,470 --> 01:44:52,203
When you learn how to transition,

2161
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,860
you know, negative energies
and that type of thing,

2162
01:44:55,860 --> 01:44:58,380
and you totally commit
yourself to something.

2163
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:01,470
That was me, but I've
learned how to separate it.

2164
01:45:01,470 --> 01:45:02,850
So I mean, I probably
wouldn't even remember

2165
01:45:02,850 --> 01:45:04,950
half the stuff or how it went even.

2166
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:09,390
So I've been very good at that, joy,

2167
01:45:09,390 --> 01:45:11,117
working for the city of Kissimmee.

2168
01:45:11,117 --> 01:45:13,443
Again, I hope to, you know,

2169
01:45:15,574 --> 01:45:18,810
it's year '24, so total,
but year five here.

2170
01:45:18,810 --> 01:45:22,710
So I really don't plan on going anywhere.

2171
01:45:22,710 --> 01:45:23,940
So I don't know if final thoughts.

2172
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:25,713
Anybody else wants to say anything?

2173
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:30,990
- Well, thank you so much
for the presentation.

2174
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:31,823
I really appreciate it

2175
01:45:31,823 --> 01:45:34,563
and I think it was very
informative and clarifying.

2176
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:40,840
One thing I think would be fun is

2177
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:44,310
to hear your

2178
01:45:44,310 --> 01:45:47,620
and the rest of city staff's
perspective in the sense that

2179
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:53,430
how can the PAB become
a more effective body,

2180
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:54,540
or what would it mean

2181
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:58,180
or what do you think it
means for a PAB to be

2182
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:01,143
best aiding the city?

2183
01:46:01,143 --> 01:46:02,820
Like I can totally understand

2184
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:04,920
if everything's functioning really well,

2185
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:07,080
everything is going the
way it's supposed to be.

2186
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:10,500
And in fact, the practice
seems to be both historically

2187
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:12,720
and currently, almost all
the things come before us.

2188
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:14,820
It's an easy approval,
everything's kind of okay

2189
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:18,300
and it sort of meets some
legislative requirement.

2190
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:20,220
But then as a thought experiment.

2191
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:24,390
- I would say just keep
doing what you're doing.

2192
01:46:24,390 --> 01:46:29,337
Look at each application
before you critically

2193
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:35,900
and make the best
recommendations that you can.

2194
01:46:36,570 --> 01:46:37,403
- Okay.

2195
01:46:37,403 --> 01:46:38,340
Yeah, I guess.

2196
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:40,860
- I know that might not sound satisfying,

2197
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:44,200
but I promise you at some point

2198
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:50,060
you will recommend denial and
that will go to the commission

2199
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,340
and they will agree with you.

2200
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:58,020
- I guess I'd be interested to hear either

2201
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:02,580
from your past experience,
or even hypothetically,

2202
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,440
whether there's an example you experienced

2203
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:06,963
or one you could imagine where,

2204
01:47:08,047 --> 01:47:11,610
you know, you think it was a
good thing or help the city

2205
01:47:11,610 --> 01:47:15,270
or was the right choice for a even,

2206
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:17,040
you know, some other cities-
- Yes.

2207
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:20,130
- Planning Advisory Board to-
- Yes.

2208
01:47:20,130 --> 01:47:21,660
- Could you share those examples?

2209
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:23,333
Is that?
- No.

2210
01:47:23,333 --> 01:47:24,166
- Okay.

2211
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:29,733
- But yes, it is definitely,

2212
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:34,530
I know it seems like a slow slog,

2213
01:47:34,530 --> 01:47:39,530
but every now and again,
you're gonna catch something

2214
01:47:42,423 --> 01:47:44,913
and your recommendation
will make a difference.

2215
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:49,513
- I think the best thing is to,

2216
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:54,120
and I think it may be also communication,

2217
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:56,970
but I think tonight with an opportunity

2218
01:47:56,970 --> 01:48:01,970
to lean on with the staff recommendation,

2219
01:48:03,330 --> 01:48:06,610
'cause that's what you
can agree to disagree

2220
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:09,873
and agree to disagree,

2221
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:15,570
but then just consider
the reasoning again,

2222
01:48:15,570 --> 01:48:17,190
why the staff recommendation

2223
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:19,860
is the staff recommendation that it is.

2224
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:21,030
I think that's the best thing.

2225
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:25,323
And it's a hit or miss, but
it's a checks and balances.

2226
01:48:26,670 --> 01:48:29,580
And it's difficult because the bylaws

2227
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:33,240
for this Planning Advisory
Board used to require

2228
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,540
that the board members
be certain professions.

2229
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:39,750
It used to be, where it
was an engineer, architect.

2230
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:41,670
I think the county planning commission

2231
01:48:41,670 --> 01:48:42,930
is still that way.

2232
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:46,950
So I think the challenge
is when you have citizens

2233
01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:48,720
and not fully understanding,

2234
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:50,580
and then the same thing, vice versa

2235
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:55,260
with not fully understanding the different

2236
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:58,320
design aspects of it or what have you.

2237
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,360
So that's where it becomes
a little bit difficult,

2238
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:02,847
and it'd be sometimes even
frustrating because of that.

2239
01:49:02,847 --> 01:49:06,000
But the city changed that
because the city is smaller

2240
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:10,470
and they're having difficulty
in filling those roles.

2241
01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:12,150
So that's why they changed it.

2242
01:49:12,150 --> 01:49:15,540
But most other places will
have probably two at large.

2243
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:18,840
And then you have professions
and people, what have you.

2244
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:21,030
It's not to say it's
a good or a bad thing,

2245
01:49:21,030 --> 01:49:26,030
but it just, it takes, it's
confusing and it's a lot.

2246
01:49:27,330 --> 01:49:31,290
But I think from here on out,
I think it is just to maybe

2247
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:34,740
a different understanding
and perspective here.

2248
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:36,930
We are to report to, you know,

2249
01:49:36,930 --> 01:49:40,440
you have questions or you
know, types of concerns.

2250
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:42,870
But I think it's just
to feel those concerns.

2251
01:49:42,870 --> 01:49:45,150
I think it's the best way to be effective,

2252
01:49:45,150 --> 01:49:49,350
but understand that is not
meant to be adversarial.

2253
01:49:49,350 --> 01:49:53,160
I think the best thing in
my experience too as well

2254
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:57,183
is that the staff recommendation
really goes a long way.

2255
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:03,570
It even goes from a legal
aspect of it too as well.

2256
01:50:03,570 --> 01:50:05,103
And so, by the way,

2257
01:50:06,870 --> 01:50:09,210
I mean for injunctions

2258
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:12,600
and all of that stuff, where with that,

2259
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:13,950
we've already talked about that,

2260
01:50:13,950 --> 01:50:18,120
where you have to be involved
with a challenge too.

2261
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:20,250
But it's expert staff.

2262
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:22,802
There's a term for it, expert competence,

2263
01:50:22,802 --> 01:50:25,320
staff experience.

2264
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:27,150
And it goes a long way.

2265
01:50:27,150 --> 01:50:31,350
- Which leads me to when would you guys

2266
01:50:31,350 --> 01:50:33,783
like to have legal training?

2267
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:37,463
Anyone?

2268
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:39,813
It's so fun.

2269
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:42,330
- So just so y'all know,

2270
01:50:42,330 --> 01:50:45,480
the last time we did both in one night

2271
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:47,640
and we said never again (laughs)

2272
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:50,070
It was like, yeah, it
was just way too much,

2273
01:50:50,070 --> 01:50:51,372
that's why we separated out.

2274
01:50:51,372 --> 01:50:52,950
But with that,

2275
01:50:52,950 --> 01:50:54,120
that's a good segue.
- Should we be until

2276
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:55,080
the new year

2277
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:56,680
Meeting?
- That's a good segue.

2278
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:01,470
- It was a real question.

2279
01:51:01,470 --> 01:51:03,072
Oh yes. No.
- It was.

2280
01:51:03,072 --> 01:51:05,010
- You have to go through it.

2281
01:51:05,010 --> 01:51:07,690
- Yes. I'm-
- I know. I wish.

2282
01:51:07,690 --> 01:51:09,030
- I was one sided.

2283
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:11,130
- I'm personally busy in two weeks,

2284
01:51:11,130 --> 01:51:14,220
but like a month from
now, four weeks from now.

2285
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:15,053
When is that?

2286
01:51:15,053 --> 01:51:17,340
That's first week of December.
- December.

2287
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:20,820
- So we'll say next year.
- Next year. How about that?

2288
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:23,127
- Absolutely. Next year.
- Okay.

2289
01:51:23,127 --> 01:51:23,960
- Yes.

2290
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:24,963
- Let's get through the holidays.

2291
01:51:24,963 --> 01:51:25,796
- Yes.

2292
01:51:25,796 --> 01:51:27,813
- Although I already know I am traveling-

2293
01:51:29,096 --> 01:51:32,040
- January.
- January 7th,

2294
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:34,170
two weeks in January,
starting January 7th.

2295
01:51:34,170 --> 01:51:37,350
So I would request that we do
either do like the last week

2296
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:39,560
of January or start of
February or something.

2297
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:40,393
- Okay.

2298
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,173
- It's gonna be really exciting.

2299
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:45,530
- I'm looking forward to it.

2300
01:51:46,368 --> 01:51:48,188
(participant speaking off mic)

2301
01:51:48,188 --> 01:51:49,021
- No.

2302
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:52,020
Even more boring than that.

2303
01:51:52,020 --> 01:51:56,190
Quasi-judicial, public records.

2304
01:51:56,190 --> 01:51:57,864
- Ethics.

2305
01:51:57,864 --> 01:51:58,697
- Ethics.

2306
01:51:58,697 --> 01:52:00,197
- Sunshine and all.
- All the good stuff.

2307
01:52:00,197 --> 01:52:01,410
All the good stuff.

2308
01:52:01,410 --> 01:52:03,783
- Yeah, I guess that's
one thing. So, okay.

2309
01:52:04,650 --> 01:52:08,580
I, once again, thank you so
much for the presentation

2310
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:09,840
and I sort of agree with you.

2311
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:12,870
Like I also really respect the experience

2312
01:52:12,870 --> 01:52:15,780
and everything that city
staff has and everything.

2313
01:52:15,780 --> 01:52:19,680
I also, you know, I wanna kind of try

2314
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:22,320
to be an effective body,
and do our civic duty

2315
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:25,200
and try everything we can
to make the city better.

2316
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:29,370
One of the challenges
I feel on the board is,

2317
01:52:29,370 --> 01:52:30,270
yeah, a combination of,

2318
01:52:30,270 --> 01:52:32,460
maybe we get into it
things like Robert's rules

2319
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:34,920
and the fact that planning
is a very big subject

2320
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:36,840
and one that does require
a lot of expertise,

2321
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,190
I think to know well.

2322
01:52:38,190 --> 01:52:40,053
As a Citizen Advisory Board,

2323
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:47,160
I think it's easy to feel
swamped by all of that.

2324
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:49,980
And the easiest thing to
just kind of like shut down

2325
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:53,910
and not try to do a good
job of evaluating things

2326
01:52:53,910 --> 01:52:55,470
and asking questions and stuff like that.

2327
01:52:55,470 --> 01:53:00,240
And I guess I just also request

2328
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:02,250
some understanding or some patience

2329
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:05,820
as I personally or the board
generally tries to learn

2330
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:08,920
and tries to, you know,
sort of learn on the job

2331
01:53:11,831 --> 01:53:15,510
and try to do what's best for the city.

2332
01:53:15,510 --> 01:53:20,070
- But again, that's where staff comes in.

2333
01:53:20,070 --> 01:53:24,150
I cannot stress enough
that I was responsible

2334
01:53:24,150 --> 01:53:28,290
for putting together a
planning and zoning board

2335
01:53:28,290 --> 01:53:30,930
from scratch from another city.

2336
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:33,060
And it was contentious,

2337
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:35,280
but I had the support
from the city manager

2338
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:39,270
and we had to vet out whether
or not we wanted to do bylaws

2339
01:53:39,270 --> 01:53:40,950
or what have you, and
that was a steep learn.

2340
01:53:40,950 --> 01:53:43,200
Oh, one of the first times,
this is a reiteration

2341
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:47,730
of the same PowerPoint
presentation that I had to do.

2342
01:53:47,730 --> 01:53:51,960
And that was difficult enough to do.

2343
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:56,960
But I think again, it's
building that rapport.

2344
01:53:57,270 --> 01:53:59,880
One of the things was
building that rapport

2345
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:02,370
with that planning and zoning board.

2346
01:54:02,370 --> 01:54:04,530
I understand again that there's questions

2347
01:54:04,530 --> 01:54:08,190
and different things, but
it's building that rapport

2348
01:54:08,190 --> 01:54:09,783
with your staff.

2349
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:12,120
With the staff.

2350
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:14,908
I sat down with literally.

2351
01:54:14,908 --> 01:54:17,370
And Mike does that too,
with the agenda review.

2352
01:54:17,370 --> 01:54:20,400
Like there's so much vetting leading up to

2353
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:22,500
that city commission.

2354
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:26,586
When these recommendations go
from PAB to city commission,

2355
01:54:26,586 --> 01:54:29,880
that, what you see for city commission

2356
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:34,020
is reviewed by my boss,
the assistant director,

2357
01:54:34,020 --> 01:54:36,930
then Craig, then Mike,

2358
01:54:36,930 --> 01:54:39,720
and Olga, and the city clerk.

2359
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:43,380
There are modifications, there
are changes that are made

2360
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:47,040
before you even see
that published on that.

2361
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:49,020
There's so much vetting.

2362
01:54:49,020 --> 01:54:53,730
I do not do this stuff in a vacuum.

2363
01:54:53,730 --> 01:54:57,060
There's so much checks and what you see

2364
01:54:57,060 --> 01:54:59,400
coming out with the
agenda and modifications

2365
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:00,900
and things like that.

2366
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:05,130
That it's just really
building that rapport

2367
01:55:05,130 --> 01:55:07,080
with the staff, again.

2368
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:09,630
You have questions, but I
think that really helped

2369
01:55:09,630 --> 01:55:12,180
the different personalities on that board.

2370
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:14,880
Oh God (laughs)

2371
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:18,840
I don't wanna stereotype,
but I have just really,

2372
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:22,838
I had to say, okay, you can't
say that during the meeting.

2373
01:55:22,838 --> 01:55:23,970
(Brenda laughing)

2374
01:55:23,970 --> 01:55:25,170
You can't do that.

2375
01:55:25,170 --> 01:55:26,130
And it's just going through,

2376
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:29,670
like, you definitely cannot
say that during the meeting.

2377
01:55:29,670 --> 01:55:33,331
You definitely cannot say
that to me during the meeting,

2378
01:55:33,331 --> 01:55:37,740
and just be mindful and just
building that from scratch.

2379
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:39,900
So I have been there and I've done that

2380
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:44,670
and I can tell you is
to build that rapport

2381
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:45,993
with your staff,

2382
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:52,010
'cause that can go a long
way, a long way, ultimately.

2383
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:57,000
That's what we're here for.

2384
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,100
And again, just to reiterate too, as well,

2385
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:02,703
we can meet with y'all individually.

2386
01:56:03,990 --> 01:56:05,310
- I guess with that,

2387
01:56:05,310 --> 01:56:07,140
I mean, we can get into
it with the legal thing,

2388
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:10,020
but again, not an expert,

2389
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:13,440
but my takeaway from
things like Sunshine Law

2390
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:16,110
and the things there
is that the intention,

2391
01:56:16,110 --> 01:56:18,330
like the full intention of
those laws are, you know,

2392
01:56:18,330 --> 01:56:21,810
as a Citizen Advisory Board,
as a public committee,

2393
01:56:21,810 --> 01:56:24,450
all of the business that we do
and all of those discussions

2394
01:56:24,450 --> 01:56:27,810
are meant to be in the
public eye for review.

2395
01:56:27,810 --> 01:56:30,163
And so I guess like that's
part of it is it feels

2396
01:56:30,163 --> 01:56:35,163
a little weird for there
to be too much discussion

2397
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:39,420
and too much kind of decision
making outside of this room.

2398
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:41,070
You know, like what's the
point of the meetings, right?

2399
01:56:41,070 --> 01:56:43,080
What's the point of like, isn't that like,

2400
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:45,330
I guess to me it seems like that,

2401
01:56:45,330 --> 01:56:46,560
isn't that what's supposed to happen here?

2402
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:48,006
Those sort of discussions, right?

2403
01:56:48,006 --> 01:56:48,861
If we have questions,

2404
01:56:48,861 --> 01:56:49,694
is it just the right place to ask them?

2405
01:56:49,694 --> 01:56:51,390
- But those meetings with
staff are not decision making,

2406
01:56:51,390 --> 01:56:53,879
they're questions if you may.

2407
01:56:53,879 --> 01:56:58,170
- And I understand that

2408
01:56:58,170 --> 01:56:59,343
I guess,

2409
01:57:02,164 --> 01:57:05,667
it also feels like this should be like

2410
01:57:06,937 --> 01:57:09,330
a sort of safe space to
ask questions, right?

2411
01:57:09,330 --> 01:57:10,163
Is that?

2412
01:57:10,163 --> 01:57:13,380
- And I'm not advocating
or taking that away,

2413
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:18,090
but again, it's that due process nature

2414
01:57:18,090 --> 01:57:19,980
that we try to make this, you know,

2415
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:22,290
a bit timely for the applicants

2416
01:57:22,290 --> 01:57:25,440
and to vet out no differently
than city commission.

2417
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:26,643
They have agenda review.

2418
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:30,120
The commissioners actually,

2419
01:57:30,120 --> 01:57:33,540
Mike sits with the city
commission individually

2420
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:35,220
to go over any questions or concerns

2421
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:37,260
that they may have before the meeting.

2422
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:39,360
- Those are public meetings?

2423
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:44,010
- They're individual meetings
as individual commissioner

2424
01:57:44,010 --> 01:57:45,900
with the city manager.

2425
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:49,950
No differently, again, for us
sitting with any individual

2426
01:57:49,950 --> 01:57:51,873
board members questions or concerns.

2427
01:57:52,830 --> 01:57:54,510
- Yeah, I guess he meets

2428
01:57:54,510 --> 01:57:56,880
with each one individually one at a time.

2429
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:58,053
There's not, yeah.

2430
01:58:00,043 --> 01:58:00,990
- And it's no different.

2431
01:58:00,990 --> 01:58:03,090
Here again, it is just to again,

2432
01:58:03,090 --> 01:58:06,093
due process and not for long.
- We'll talk about this,

2433
01:58:06,093 --> 01:58:07,699
We'll talk about this in February.

2434
01:58:07,699 --> 01:58:09,660
- Yeah.
- But yes.

2435
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:12,870
And you two, I saw you two talking.

2436
01:58:12,870 --> 01:58:16,140
No talking, okay.

2437
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:21,140
Unless you're talking about
your dogs or kids or whatever.

2438
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:25,320
No talking about officials, city business

2439
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:27,663
or anything that could come before you.

2440
01:58:30,690 --> 01:58:33,509
- And so Yeah.

2441
01:58:33,509 --> 01:58:35,550
- Unless you say it on the record.

2442
01:58:35,550 --> 01:58:39,033
- So suggestions like that make it,

2443
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,330
yeah, just trying to be open here, right?

2444
01:58:42,330 --> 01:58:44,140
Like one of my initial reactions to that

2445
01:58:44,140 --> 01:58:45,570
is to then shut down

2446
01:58:45,570 --> 01:58:48,390
and sort of be unwilling
to say anything, right?

2447
01:58:48,390 --> 01:58:49,290
Or ask anything.

2448
01:58:49,290 --> 01:58:51,543
And I guess,

2449
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:56,670
I would rather feel, even
if I'm learning and stuff,

2450
01:58:56,670 --> 01:59:00,900
I wanna feel free to ask stupid questions.

2451
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:04,153
My understanding is provided
I do it in the public forum,

2452
01:59:04,153 --> 01:59:06,060
that's totally cool, right?

2453
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:08,130
- If you do it in a public forum,

2454
01:59:08,130 --> 01:59:12,150
or if you do it with a staff member.

2455
01:59:12,150 --> 01:59:13,530
- Individually.

2456
01:59:13,530 --> 01:59:14,809
- Individually.

2457
01:59:14,809 --> 01:59:17,580
As long as you don't talk to any

2458
01:59:17,580 --> 01:59:20,100
of your other board members.

2459
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:21,113
- Yes, okay. And then-

2460
01:59:22,101 --> 01:59:26,130
- Regarding anything that
is pending before the board

2461
01:59:26,130 --> 01:59:30,926
or that foreseeably could
be pending before the board

2462
01:59:30,926 --> 01:59:34,530
or something that may
pertain to city business.

2463
01:59:34,530 --> 01:59:36,000
We'll get to this in February.

2464
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,953
It's gonna be fun, you'll love it.

2465
01:59:38,790 --> 01:59:41,700
- And then I guess my comment
to the rest of the board then

2466
01:59:41,700 --> 01:59:43,890
is since this is one of the only places

2467
01:59:43,890 --> 01:59:45,900
we're allowed to talk to one another,

2468
01:59:45,900 --> 01:59:47,670
it feels like part of being

2469
01:59:47,670 --> 01:59:49,890
an effective Planning Advisory Board

2470
01:59:49,890 --> 01:59:52,260
and having a sense of
rapport is also for us

2471
01:59:52,260 --> 01:59:54,870
to kind of build a sense of
rapport with one another.

2472
01:59:54,870 --> 01:59:58,950
So, you know, we have a discussion
on our agenda each time,

2473
01:59:58,950 --> 02:00:02,280
and I think we could,

2474
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:05,250
that it feels like that's
one of the only legal places

2475
02:00:05,250 --> 02:00:06,690
that we have in order for us

2476
02:00:06,690 --> 02:00:10,710
to talk about planning or
the comprehensive plan or.

2477
02:00:10,710 --> 02:00:14,516
- So do you think we should
bring sandwiches next time?

2478
02:00:14,516 --> 02:00:15,510
- I mean.

2479
02:00:15,510 --> 02:00:17,793
- I agree. That'd be awesome.

2480
02:00:19,284 --> 02:00:21,145
(participant speaking off mic)

2481
02:00:21,145 --> 02:00:21,978
- Yeah.

2482
02:00:21,978 --> 02:00:23,190
- I'm glad you brought
that up too as well.

2483
02:00:23,190 --> 02:00:26,760
So try to make those discussions general.

2484
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:27,660
I think we kind of vet,

2485
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:30,090
but just, because it's a learning here,

2486
02:00:30,090 --> 02:00:35,033
those discussions general and
not any previous agenda items,

2487
02:00:35,033 --> 02:00:37,830
because again, it's due
process or what have you,

2488
02:00:37,830 --> 02:00:40,560
but they're intended to be
just general discussions

2489
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:44,460
and not about previous agenda items.

2490
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:45,960
- But then if we were ever going

2491
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:47,733
to discuss a previous agenda item,

2492
02:00:49,380 --> 02:00:51,453
isn't this the only place that we could?

2493
02:00:52,322 --> 02:00:53,155
(participant speaking off mic)

2494
02:00:53,155 --> 02:00:53,988
- Yes.
- I know.

2495
02:00:53,988 --> 02:00:56,677
And then what?

2496
02:00:56,677 --> 02:00:57,751
- No.

2497
02:00:57,751 --> 02:00:59,661
- There's no exceptions.

2498
02:00:59,661 --> 02:01:04,661
- I mean, if something has
already been decided, finalized,

2499
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:09,723
then you could discuss it.

2500
02:01:11,490 --> 02:01:14,043
Anything that happens in this board,

2501
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:18,813
aside from conditional use,

2502
02:01:20,970 --> 02:01:24,040
and true work of art

2503
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:27,693
- That's administrative,
that's administrative.

2504
02:01:29,850 --> 02:01:32,160
- Other than that, I mean,

2505
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:37,160
everything that is decided
here goes to city commission.

2506
02:01:37,620 --> 02:01:42,620
One City commission has
a final determination.

2507
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:44,400
If you guys are hanging out

2508
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:47,880
and you wanna talk about
it amongst yourselves

2509
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:51,900
after the fact, I would
still recommend caution

2510
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:55,830
because you never know if some aspect

2511
02:01:55,830 --> 02:02:00,020
of that is not going to come back to you,

2512
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:02,190
it probably would not.

2513
02:02:02,190 --> 02:02:03,023
But.

2514
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:05,910
- Yeah, I guess.

2515
02:02:05,910 --> 02:02:07,950
- Okay, so this is probably
the kind of comment

2516
02:02:07,950 --> 02:02:09,870
that you would rather I not make,

2517
02:02:09,870 --> 02:02:11,943
but I mean in the sense that like.

2518
02:02:14,070 --> 02:02:17,310
Okay, part of the difficulty
I have is, on the one hand,

2519
02:02:17,310 --> 02:02:19,890
it feels like a lot of the discussion

2520
02:02:19,890 --> 02:02:21,870
that we have about the
rules and the procedures

2521
02:02:21,870 --> 02:02:24,330
and the laws that were sort of governed by

2522
02:02:24,330 --> 02:02:28,260
feels very consequential, right?

2523
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:31,920
I mean, I think, you know,
sunshine law is a big deal

2524
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:35,820
and these things have
potentially big consequences.

2525
02:02:35,820 --> 02:02:38,613
The other end of the spectrum
as an advisory board,

2526
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:42,780
the like actual agency,

2527
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:44,880
and power that we have is very limited.

2528
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:46,740
We actually don't get
to do much of anything

2529
02:02:46,740 --> 02:02:50,580
except make and give advice
to the city commission.

2530
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:52,140
- That's true.

2531
02:02:52,140 --> 02:02:54,780
- Recommendations to the city commission.

2532
02:02:54,780 --> 02:02:57,663
So then part of me is, I guess I don't,

2533
02:02:58,770 --> 02:03:01,800
it feels like if we're
gonna be most effective

2534
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:05,673
and make the most
effective recommendations,

2535
02:03:08,342 --> 02:03:12,930
I don't know, I guess I'd
like to not feel afraid

2536
02:03:12,930 --> 02:03:15,630
to talk about things.

2537
02:03:15,630 --> 02:03:16,650
I mean in the sense that,

2538
02:03:16,650 --> 02:03:19,320
I mean, we're in a public forum.

2539
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:20,520
As long as we're in the public forum,

2540
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:22,590
we're talking with one
another in the public forum.

2541
02:03:22,590 --> 02:03:24,120
I mean, the reality is no one listens

2542
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:25,620
to any of these things anyway.

2543
02:03:26,850 --> 02:03:29,400
I feel like we can talk about things

2544
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:30,840
and try to come to

2545
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:33,030
what we think are
intelligent recommendations.

2546
02:03:33,030 --> 02:03:33,863
I mean.

2547
02:03:33,863 --> 02:03:34,696
- Yes.

2548
02:03:35,670 --> 02:03:38,130
With that said, this is the forum.

2549
02:03:38,130 --> 02:03:39,480
- Yeah. It has to happen in here, yeah.

2550
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:42,450
- To have those conversations.

2551
02:03:42,450 --> 02:03:44,280
And at the end of the day,

2552
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:48,540
it is a recommendation.

2553
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:51,480
And as frustrating as that may be,

2554
02:03:51,480 --> 02:03:56,480
or as extensive and as
thoughtful as the process may be

2555
02:03:57,810 --> 02:04:00,390
for each board member,

2556
02:04:00,390 --> 02:04:03,970
at the end, it is just a
recommendation, period.

2557
02:04:07,710 --> 02:04:09,873
So it's a yay or nay, and.

2558
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:13,500
- With your example that you're using,

2559
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:15,360
you made a decision last planning board,

2560
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:18,300
and now you wanna come back to
it on another planning board.

2561
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:21,183
That applicant that got
their decision made,

2562
02:04:22,290 --> 02:04:25,020
when they had it first,

2563
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:28,020
they now expect legally
this is what we're doing.

2564
02:04:28,020 --> 02:04:31,890
So when you have a conversation
about it in another meeting,

2565
02:04:31,890 --> 02:04:34,650
that then leaves that applicant
outta that conversation,

2566
02:04:34,650 --> 02:04:37,680
and that could open us up to legal issues.

2567
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:41,160
- But there, I think there's
a strong distinction, right?

2568
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:45,060
Between a conversation
like, I totally understand

2569
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:47,640
that if we were going to
invoke Robert's rules of order,

2570
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:50,850
there's specific procedures
to try to revisit

2571
02:04:50,850 --> 02:04:54,030
an old motion and re rule on it.

2572
02:04:54,030 --> 02:04:57,150
Even if that constituted an
official re recommendation

2573
02:04:57,150 --> 02:04:58,470
of an old business item.

2574
02:04:58,470 --> 02:04:59,670
And I'm not suggesting that,

2575
02:04:59,670 --> 02:05:01,530
and I understand that
that would definitely

2576
02:05:01,530 --> 02:05:03,540
then trigger reporting requirements

2577
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:06,150
and participation from the applicants.

2578
02:05:06,150 --> 02:05:09,270
But now as an advisory
board, as any living entity,

2579
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:10,500
if you're going to get better

2580
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:13,470
and learn from experience,
part of that is feedback.

2581
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:14,790
And it feels like,

2582
02:05:14,790 --> 02:05:17,610
I guess I don't understand the danger

2583
02:05:17,610 --> 02:05:21,630
if we in trying to learn or trying to read

2584
02:05:21,630 --> 02:05:24,367
or trying to talk about
something, if afterwards we say,

2585
02:05:24,367 --> 02:05:26,490
"Oh, you know, a year ago we talked about

2586
02:05:26,490 --> 02:05:27,323
this kind of thing."

2587
02:05:27,323 --> 02:05:30,840
And you know, if we asked a
clarifying question of staff

2588
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:33,030
or if we talked about what we thought

2589
02:05:33,030 --> 02:05:34,353
that meant or something,

2590
02:05:35,584 --> 02:05:37,320
we're not making an
official recommendation

2591
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:39,390
that doesn't feel like it's legally bind,

2592
02:05:39,390 --> 02:05:40,890
the issue has already been settled.

2593
02:05:40,890 --> 02:05:45,890
- So what you're saying is,
can you bring up old stuff,

2594
02:05:47,460 --> 02:05:52,433
even though you're not
going to advise on that,

2595
02:05:54,690 --> 02:05:57,873
because the issue is
already done resolved?

2596
02:05:58,740 --> 02:06:02,220
Can you talk about it again?

2597
02:06:02,220 --> 02:06:04,195
- Just so a specific example.

2598
02:06:04,195 --> 02:06:05,418
- Sure.
- Yeah.

2599
02:06:05,418 --> 02:06:06,251
- Sure.

2600
02:06:06,251 --> 02:06:07,110
- Yeah.
- Of course.

2601
02:06:07,110 --> 02:06:08,490
This is the forum.

2602
02:06:08,490 --> 02:06:11,160
This is the only forum, period.

2603
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:11,993
- Perfect.

2604
02:06:12,990 --> 02:06:15,139
And then okay, that's great.

2605
02:06:15,139 --> 02:06:17,790
That sounds very clarifying.

2606
02:06:17,790 --> 02:06:22,790
I guess, but I also don't
mean to beat a dead horse,

2607
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:24,978
but I guess I feel like

2608
02:06:24,978 --> 02:06:29,284
the implication I was reading is,

2609
02:06:29,284 --> 02:06:31,860
maybe I did a bad job of expressing myself

2610
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:34,710
or communicating that idea,
I think you did a great job.

2611
02:06:34,710 --> 02:06:36,480
But then the impression I get

2612
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:38,010
is when that's immediately followed up

2613
02:06:38,010 --> 02:06:39,660
by like a careful like,

2614
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:41,370
oh, but if you do this,
it might mean this,

2615
02:06:41,370 --> 02:06:44,170
if this, it might have legal
implications or whatever.

2616
02:06:44,170 --> 02:06:46,623
I interpret that as,

2617
02:06:48,450 --> 02:06:49,740
no, actually you really shouldn't.

2618
02:06:49,740 --> 02:06:52,083
And then I'm not, you
know, and that's the.

2619
02:06:52,961 --> 02:06:54,923
- This is a safe space, right?

2620
02:06:54,923 --> 02:06:57,900
This is the only safe space.
- Good.

2621
02:06:57,900 --> 02:07:01,920
- Do not talk about
official public business

2622
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:03,870
outside of this forum.
- Understood.

2623
02:07:03,870 --> 02:07:05,460
- If you wanna talk about things

2624
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:10,460
that have happened in the
past, that might come back,

2625
02:07:12,625 --> 02:07:15,930
and even if they don't,

2626
02:07:15,930 --> 02:07:18,840
there's always potential.

2627
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:20,490
This is the forum.

2628
02:07:20,490 --> 02:07:21,323
- Perfect.

2629
02:07:21,323 --> 02:07:24,600
- And let's just be gentle.

2630
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:28,470
Let's not abuse this forum, that's all.

2631
02:07:28,470 --> 02:07:32,520
- And just as Steph, 'cause
you asked our perspective.

2632
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:33,780
Two things.

2633
02:07:33,780 --> 02:07:35,370
One, trust.

2634
02:07:35,370 --> 02:07:39,360
I understand that you are
learning, and we're learning.

2635
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:41,730
We are all learning every single day.

2636
02:07:41,730 --> 02:07:42,993
Trust us, please.

2637
02:07:43,950 --> 02:07:46,440
We are here to help our community,

2638
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:48,540
that's why I have my profession.

2639
02:07:48,540 --> 02:07:49,740
And when I have somebody

2640
02:07:49,740 --> 02:07:53,040
who doesn't trust me in doing my job,

2641
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:54,843
that creates hostility.

2642
02:07:55,950 --> 02:07:56,783
Trust us.

2643
02:07:56,783 --> 02:07:57,720
And we trust you.

2644
02:07:57,720 --> 02:07:59,310
You have never asked a stupid question,

2645
02:07:59,310 --> 02:08:00,660
you have never asked anything.

2646
02:08:00,660 --> 02:08:04,260
All the questions that you
have ever asked make sense.

2647
02:08:04,260 --> 02:08:06,090
Please just trust us.

2648
02:08:06,090 --> 02:08:07,710
'Cause we wanna make sure

2649
02:08:07,710 --> 02:08:09,960
that we're doing best for the community.

2650
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:12,300
You wanna do what's
best for the community.

2651
02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:14,100
You have a different perspective,

2652
02:08:14,100 --> 02:08:17,610
which has made us think of
our projects in other ways.

2653
02:08:17,610 --> 02:08:21,210
It's been great, but
there has to be a trust,

2654
02:08:21,210 --> 02:08:23,790
and sometimes it feels like there's not.

2655
02:08:23,790 --> 02:08:25,353
And then my second part,

2656
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:27,870
and I think we kinda learned this today,

2657
02:08:27,870 --> 02:08:30,710
but I just, the comprehensive plan

2658
02:08:30,710 --> 02:08:33,753
is this beautiful aspiration
that we are going for.

2659
02:08:34,650 --> 02:08:36,900
I think what would help is the LDC

2660
02:08:36,900 --> 02:08:39,753
is what gives us the
teeth to then do that.

2661
02:08:40,980 --> 02:08:44,880
The LDC is what we actually look at,

2662
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:47,940
and it solidifies code-wise,
this is what you do.

2663
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:49,953
Here's your setbacks, here's this.

2664
02:08:51,150 --> 02:08:54,240
Comprehensive plan is this
beautiful image of what we want,

2665
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:56,220
the LDC is how we get there.

2666
02:08:56,220 --> 02:08:59,040
So honestly, I would say look at the LDCA

2667
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:01,733
a lot more than you are looking
at the comprehensive plan.

2668
02:09:02,794 --> 02:09:03,627
And to be honest,

2669
02:09:03,627 --> 02:09:05,730
with the questions that you
ask and how you ask them,

2670
02:09:05,730 --> 02:09:07,500
you are a brilliant person.

2671
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:08,997
You're gonna read that LDC,

2672
02:09:08,997 --> 02:09:11,310
and it's gonna start
to make sense for you.

2673
02:09:11,310 --> 02:09:15,510
And the questions that I think
you have the confusion on,

2674
02:09:15,510 --> 02:09:17,043
it's gonna clarify it for you.

2675
02:09:17,970 --> 02:09:22,350
So less of comprehensive, more on the LDC.

2676
02:09:22,350 --> 02:09:24,393
And those are just my, thank you.

2677
02:09:25,650 --> 02:09:26,690
- Yeah.

2678
02:09:26,690 --> 02:09:28,527
So, I really appreciate that. Thank you.

2679
02:09:28,527 --> 02:09:30,900
And yeah, I also like, yeah,

2680
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:32,670
to get it out there
like reciprocal, right?

2681
02:09:32,670 --> 02:09:37,670
Like I really do trust your
guys' experience and everything.

2682
02:09:38,910 --> 02:09:42,720
I also, you know, try to do a good job

2683
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:43,980
and read things independently,

2684
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:45,390
and ask questions if
they don't make sense.

2685
02:09:45,390 --> 02:09:48,030
And I don't want those
questions to come across,

2686
02:09:48,030 --> 02:09:50,100
even if I do a really
bad job of asking them

2687
02:09:50,100 --> 02:09:52,080
as adversarial or distrustful,

2688
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:54,207
like I legitimately don't know the answers

2689
02:09:54,207 --> 02:09:55,607
and trying to figure it out.

2690
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:59,883
And I appreciate patience as I do that.

2691
02:10:02,545 --> 02:10:03,781
So thank you.

2692
02:10:03,781 --> 02:10:07,020
- So everybody loves everybody.

2693
02:10:07,020 --> 02:10:08,580
- Perfect.
- God bless America.

2694
02:10:08,580 --> 02:10:11,250
And do we have a motion to adjourn?

2695
02:10:11,250 --> 02:10:13,233
- I will make a motion to adjourn.

2696
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:14,993
- Second.

2697
02:10:24,295 --> 02:10:29,295
- I mean, so adjourned.

2698
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:32,240
So I made the motion.

2699
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:33,540
This is not germane,

2700
02:10:33,540 --> 02:10:35,580
but now that we made the motion,
we can discuss the motion

2701
02:10:35,580 --> 02:10:36,840
in reading Robert's rules of order.

2702
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:39,810
They have a special section for how to do,

2703
02:10:39,810 --> 02:10:42,090
we don't have to approve
it, but go for it.

2704
02:10:42,090 --> 02:10:43,020
Let's vote.

2705
02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:45,150
All those in favor say aye.

2706
02:10:45,150 --> 02:10:45,983
- Aye.

2707
02:10:45,983 --> 02:10:47,460
- All those opposed.

2708
02:10:47,460 --> 02:10:49,290
- All right. Hearing
none, the ayes have it,

2709
02:10:49,290 --> 02:10:50,223
We are adjourned.

2710
02:10:55,837 --> 02:10:57,887
- It doesn't require approval for boards.

2711
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:00,670
Are we gonna meet through December?

2712
02:11:05,220 --> 02:11:06,432
- So now we're closed for business.

2713
02:11:06,432 --> 02:11:08,603
- Are we gonna be doing
anything in December?

2714
02:11:11,790 --> 02:11:13,961
- Oh, we talking about dock?

2715
02:11:13,961 --> 02:11:18,247
- No, no, I meant like a
party. I meant like a party.
