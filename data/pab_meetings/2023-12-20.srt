1
00:00:03,148 --> 00:00:04,435
- Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:04,435 --> 00:00:05,268
Welcome.

3
00:00:05,268 --> 00:00:08,370
Calling the meeting to order at 6:00.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,522
Please stand for a moment of silence

5
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:12,939
and the Pledge of Allegiance.

6
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:28,852
- Of the United States of America

7
00:00:28,852 --> 00:00:31,410
and to the Republic for which it stands,

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,351
one Nation under God, indivisible,

9
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:36,560
with liberty and justice for all.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,480
- Thank you, everyone.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,426
Going to ask everyone,

12
00:00:39,426 --> 00:00:42,360
please make sure to silence
any electronic devices.

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,720
Including and those of
us up here on the dais.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,594
And also going to ask that
all of our board members,

15
00:00:49,594 --> 00:00:51,626
if there are any conflicts of interest,

16
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:54,192
if you've had ex parte
communications, site visits,

17
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:56,510
research on your own, anything like that,

18
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,564
please make that known prior to each item.

19
00:01:00,564 --> 00:01:04,860
I will remember to say that
before each item as well.

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,838
Okay.

21
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:10,255
First minutes, approval of
the September 6th minutes.

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,000
Do we have any motions regarding
the September 6th minutes?

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,656
Robert Spalding, motion to approve.

24
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:19,489
- I second.

25
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:21,372
- We have a second, Melissa Thacker.

26
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,373
Any discussion or changes?

27
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,206
No.

28
00:01:23,206 --> 00:01:24,715
All in favor, please say aye.

29
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:25,548
- Aye.
- Aye.

30
00:01:25,548 --> 00:01:26,870
- Opposed please say no.

31
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,868
I'm hearing none.

32
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:29,516
Those minutes are approved.

33
00:01:29,516 --> 00:01:33,110
And next up, October
4th, PAV meeting minutes.

34
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,918
Do we have a motion
regarding those minutes?

35
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:35,751
- Motion to approve.

36
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:37,084
- Motion to approve, Diana.

37
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:38,972
And we have a second from Roberts.

38
00:01:38,972 --> 00:01:40,970
Any other discussion or changes?

39
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,815
If not, all in favor, please say aye.

40
00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:43,648
- Aye.
- Aye.

41
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:45,018
- Opposed please say no.

42
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:46,068
Hearing none.

43
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:47,428
Minutes are approved.

44
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:51,345
And next up, we have the
November 15th minutes.

45
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:56,041
Do we have any motions regarding that?

46
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:56,881
- Motion to approve.

47
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:58,916
- Robert Spalding motion to approve.

48
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:00,226
And second, we have second.

49
00:02:00,226 --> 00:02:01,671
Diana, any changes?

50
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:02,504
Discussion?

51
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:03,337
No.

52
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:04,502
All in favor, please say aye.

53
00:02:04,502 --> 00:02:05,335
- Aye.
- Aye.

54
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:06,274
- Opposed please say no.

55
00:02:06,274 --> 00:02:07,107
Hearing none.

56
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:09,233
Minutes are approved in absolutely.

57
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:10,066
Okay.

58
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:12,210
Old business, nothing under there.

59
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,572
New business, 5A public hearing.

60
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:17,350
Conditional use for site plan
waiver for private school.

61
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,252
- Yes, this is a conditional use request

62
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:21,452
for a site plan waiver

63
00:02:21,452 --> 00:02:24,752
for a private school at 3030 Lions court

64
00:02:24,752 --> 00:02:29,480
and at 3051 Lions Court for
the Nazaret Christian Academy.

65
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,362
As included on the staff report.

66
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:36,144
The existing school is
at 3051 Lions Court.

67
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:37,582
That's going to be on the right hand side,

68
00:02:37,582 --> 00:02:39,740
the larger parcel.

69
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,490
That school has received approval

70
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:46,780
from our planning advisory board in 1995.

71
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,110
The church has an existing
church on the property,

72
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,728
which is the 8,020 square foot church.

73
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:55,266
That's going to be the
structure on the right.

74
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:57,714
There's a red structure on the right,

75
00:02:57,714 --> 00:03:00,822
and the school is going to
be the structure to the left

76
00:03:00,822 --> 00:03:03,300
on the larger parcel.

77
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,748
There is an existing church

78
00:03:04,748 --> 00:03:09,380
on that property that
received approval in 1995.

79
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,579
In inquiring about expanding
the school to 3030,

80
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:15,232
which is a smaller parcel,

81
00:03:15,232 --> 00:03:18,138
we discovered that the
existing school did not go

82
00:03:18,138 --> 00:03:20,600
through this conditional use process.

83
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,296
So we decided to combine

84
00:03:23,296 --> 00:03:27,684
and to legalize the existing
school on the larger parcel

85
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:30,772
and also the approval of the expansion

86
00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:34,272
at 3030 Lions Court under one application.

87
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,578
Currently, right now, the
school has about 245 students.

88
00:03:40,578 --> 00:03:43,928
The idea is to expand
into the smaller parcel

89
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:47,280
for the high school students,
grades nine through twelve.

90
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,947
That new campus will have
approximately five classrooms.

91
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:55,148
We have that in the packet.

92
00:03:55,148 --> 00:03:58,150
No more than five
classrooms that are there.

93
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,710
The existing nine classrooms
remain on the main campus site.

94
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,942
As you can see,

95
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:08,442
it's not necessarily directly
across the street there.

96
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:12,442
The high school students
will have to go back

97
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:15,418
and forth from the main
campus to the new one.

98
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:18,846
So we included to make sure
that there was adequate type

99
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:22,452
of ADA striping and pedestrian improvement

100
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:25,112
so that way the students
can move back and forth

101
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:27,486
between the main campus and the new one.

102
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:28,830
In addition to that,

103
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,410
because the smaller parcel
does not have the room

104
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,632
or the circulation to
provide drop off and pickup,

105
00:04:36,632 --> 00:04:39,442
we're also going to lend
it that all drop off

106
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:42,758
and pickup will have to
occur on the main campus too.

107
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:45,500
And there was a circulation
plan that was included

108
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,820
of how a drop off and pickup would work.

109
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,180
The school in the church
will not conflict.

110
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,222
The hours of operations
were noted on here.

111
00:04:55,222 --> 00:04:58,928
The church activities will
be limited to Tuesdays,

112
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:01,960
Wednesdays, and Thursdays
in the evening time,

113
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,960
and Sunday services are
going to be on the weekend.

114
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,270
One nice thing is that

115
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,382
on the right hand side
you really can't see,

116
00:05:10,382 --> 00:05:12,932
there is the new improvement

117
00:05:12,932 --> 00:05:17,180
for Bill Beck Boulevard that's
there on the right hand side.

118
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,526
We are requiring, I think
it would help to as well,

119
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:24,472
for them to add an access
point to Bill Beck Boulevard

120
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:25,778
on the right hand side.

121
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:29,288
And that will utilize that
existing pavement that's

122
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:34,020
on that northeast corner,
which is the Ridge Street.

123
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,662
In addition to the expansion
on the smaller site,

124
00:05:38,662 --> 00:05:40,342
all parking too, as well.

125
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:42,236
Parking is going to be limited

126
00:05:42,236 --> 00:05:45,178
and it cannot accommodate
the high school students

127
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,112
which have the ability,

128
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,530
they have the ability to drive

129
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,800
in addition to the administration.

130
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,994
So a satellite parking agreement
will need to be entered in.

131
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:57,161
So that way the parking deficit that's

132
00:05:58,068 --> 00:05:59,998
on the smaller parcel will make up

133
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:03,180
for it on the larger parcel too, as well.

134
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,012
And with that, staff is
recommending approval subject

135
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:10,400
to these conditions that were
listed in the staff report.

136
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,233
- Thank you.

137
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:14,290
Board members, any questions
for Brenda or the City?

138
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,498
If not, is the applicant here would like

139
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:18,802
to say anything to the board?

140
00:06:18,802 --> 00:06:19,954
Address the board?

141
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:21,871
Not required, but okay.

142
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,980
Do we have any public comments
regarding this agenda item?

143
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,860
Any public comments?

144
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,045
Public comments?

145
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:31,878
No?

146
00:06:31,878 --> 00:06:32,822
Okay, with that,

147
00:06:32,822 --> 00:06:37,030
do we have any motions
regarding this agenda item?

148
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,040
- Motion to approve.

149
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,313
- Melissa Thacker, motion to approve.

150
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:42,304
We have a second, Robert Spalding.

151
00:06:42,304 --> 00:06:44,200
Any discussion?

152
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,403
If not, all in favor, please say aye.

153
00:06:46,403 --> 00:06:47,236
- Aye.
- Aye.

154
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:48,590
- Opposed please say no.

155
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,423
Hearing none.

156
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:50,860
Motion carries.

157
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,751
5B, ordinance amending future
land use map designation.

158
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:56,584
Brenda.

159
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,992
- This is a land use amendment request

160
00:07:00,992 --> 00:07:05,500
to change the future land
use designation on property,

161
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,167
about an acre or so,

162
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:11,630
from the commercial general

163
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,113
to single-family low density residential.

164
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:18,130
At one point there was a
smaller structure on this site.

165
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,047
It was removed in 2019.

166
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,232
There were attempts.

167
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:27,232
I'll get to it in a little
bit on the zoning request

168
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:29,948
that at one point that
there had been attempts

169
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:32,844
to develop this property as commercial.

170
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:37,844
However, the immediate
surrounding area is residential,

171
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,640
so we feel that it's
a bit more appropriate

172
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,736
to change the land use designation

173
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:45,372
from commercial to residential.

174
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:50,372
Access will be limited to the
street to the south there.

175
00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:53,952
I believe it's Randolph or Palmetto.

176
00:07:53,952 --> 00:07:58,084
It gets the two confused,
because the John Young Parkway,

177
00:07:58,084 --> 00:07:59,396
looking at it from the aerial,

178
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,182
it seems as if the roadway is there.

179
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:04,994
But this is the beginning of
the bridge the flyover there,

180
00:08:04,994 --> 00:08:06,818
so all access will be

181
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:09,520
from the existing roadway to the south.

182
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,008
At this time, staff is
recommending approval

183
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:13,832
to change the land use amendment

184
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:15,090
from commercial general

185
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,507
to single-family low density residential.

186
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,113
- Questions for Brenda or the City?

187
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:22,946
- I have a question.

188
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:24,246
- Go ahead, Alex.

189
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:26,678
- So I guess you said this area

190
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:28,896
is primarily low density residential.

191
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:30,602
I guess, do you have a sense

192
00:08:30,602 --> 00:08:33,258
of where the nearest
commercial properties are

193
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:35,802
to the residential properties in the area?

194
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:39,760
- There is residential
across John Young Parkway

195
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,142
and the future land use
on the south side there,

196
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:47,204
the existing self storage
is also commercial.

197
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:49,371
So it's across the street.

198
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,768
I don't know if we have the land use map,

199
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:56,552
but the nearest commercial is
across the street to the south

200
00:08:56,552 --> 00:08:58,978
and on the west side of John Young.

201
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:01,895
- Yeah, I guess I'm just wondering.

202
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,085
Putting more residential
there just means more people

203
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:06,918
that are going to have

204
00:09:06,918 --> 00:09:08,796
to leave there to go elsewhere

205
00:09:08,796 --> 00:09:11,062
to connect business or whatever, right?

206
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:13,494
Where just having a commercial lot

207
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:17,382
near otherwise residential
property seems like it

208
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:18,524
would open the possibility

209
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:22,774
to serve the local community
more locally, I guess.

210
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,160
Yeah.

211
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,586
Is there existing interest

212
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:30,042
in developing the property or something?

213
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:31,130
Or this is just the city

214
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,918
kind of thinking ahead, or what's the?

215
00:09:32,918 --> 00:09:34,382
- There is interest.

216
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:35,742
There's the applicant here.

217
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:39,940
There is interest to develop
as a single family residential.

218
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,314
The next item on the
zoning and staff report.

219
00:09:43,314 --> 00:09:45,528
There have been previous attempts.

220
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:47,672
Actually, there were
two different attempts

221
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:52,480
to develop the property
commercial, and in one case,

222
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,647
it was denied,

223
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,860
the use was not appropriate.

224
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,228
And the second was it was an
office space and a restaurant.

225
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:04,332
But it never went anywhere
with our committee.

226
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:08,309
So there was several attempts
to develop as commercial.

227
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:13,309
It's probably, hopefully it's
better success as residential.

228
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,813
- So there is an applicant
requesting this change you said?

229
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:22,133
- Yes, this is not a city initiative.

230
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:22,966
- What's that?

231
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:24,515
- This is not a city initiative.

232
00:10:24,515 --> 00:10:25,456
- Got it, okay.

233
00:10:25,456 --> 00:10:26,780
Any other questions for Brenda?

234
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,762
If not, if the applicant would like

235
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,489
to say anything to the board?

236
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:31,322
Address the board.

237
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:33,822
You're welcome to do so.

238
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:35,697
If not, do we have any public comments

239
00:10:35,697 --> 00:10:37,572
regarding this agenda item?

240
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:39,340
Any public comments?

241
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,205
Public comments?

242
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:41,038
No.

243
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:43,463
Do we have any motions regarding this?

244
00:10:43,463 --> 00:10:45,420
- I give a motion to approve.

245
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,548
- Fatima?

246
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:47,572
Motion to approve.

247
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:48,688
Do I have a second?

248
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:49,552
- I'll second.

249
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:50,385
- We have a second.

250
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:52,160
I think I heard Robert first.

251
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,410
And any further discussion?

252
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,599
If no, all in favor, please say aye.

253
00:10:58,599 --> 00:10:59,432
- Aye.
- Aye.

254
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:00,651
- Opposed please say no.

255
00:11:00,651 --> 00:11:02,317
Hearing none.

256
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:04,900
Motion carries unanimously.

257
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,900
Next up, 5C.

258
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,268
- This is a companion,

259
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:12,508
the rezoning to establish the zoning

260
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:15,782
on the property to match
the future land use change,

261
00:11:15,782 --> 00:11:16,764
changing the zoning

262
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:18,505
from the highly commercial

263
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:21,505
to the single family residential RA2

264
00:11:23,027 --> 00:11:25,652
it's previously mentioned in 1998,

265
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:29,280
there was an attempt
to change to commercial

266
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,810
for a pawn shop.

267
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,612
Planning advisory board at
the time recommended approval.

268
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:37,124
However, when it went
to the city commission,

269
00:11:37,124 --> 00:11:40,408
it was reversed the planning
advisory board approval

270
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,408
and denied that request.

271
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,152
Then in 2001, there was an attempt

272
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:50,162
to include commercial with office space,

273
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:53,976
with a dance studio, with
the restaurant addition.

274
00:11:53,976 --> 00:11:57,700
Again, it met all the
different requirements,

275
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,958
was submitted formally to the city,

276
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:03,220
but it never left our committee.

277
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,048
At that point, there has
not been any other types

278
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:09,400
of commercial applications
to come through.

279
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,328
Now, we're here with the rezoning

280
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:13,720
to change it to residential.

281
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,226
As mentioned before,

282
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:19,940
the access will be limited to
Palmetto and South Brandoff,

283
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,076
and it is compatible

284
00:12:21,076 --> 00:12:23,892
to the proposed future land use request.

285
00:12:23,892 --> 00:12:26,772
So we're recommending approval,
subject to the approval

286
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:28,996
of the Companion Land Use Amendment.

287
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:31,920
- Okay, board, any questions?

288
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,018
If not, again, if the applicant would like

289
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:36,720
to address the board,
you're welcome to do so.

290
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,440
If not, do we have any public comments?

291
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,376
Public comments?

292
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:42,053
Public comments on this agenda item?

293
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:42,886
No?

294
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:45,636
Okay, any motions regarding this?

295
00:12:46,762 --> 00:12:47,595
- Motion to approve.

296
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:49,653
- Motion to approve, Robert Spalding.

297
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:51,286
We have a second, Diana.

298
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:52,668
Any discussion?

299
00:12:52,668 --> 00:12:54,079
All in favor, please say aye.

300
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:54,912
Aye.

301
00:12:54,912 --> 00:12:56,319
Opposed please say no.

302
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:57,277
Hearing none.

303
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,034
Motion carries, 5D.

304
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:03,080
And again, I say if anyone
has any conflict of interest,

305
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,580
please make that known at
this time regarding 5D.

306
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,120
- I have a conflict with
5D, so I'll be abstaining.

307
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,000
- Okay, Melissa Thacker.

308
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,306
Conflict with 5D.

309
00:13:12,306 --> 00:13:14,560
She'll be abstaining.

310
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,393
Brenda.

311
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,695
- This is a rezoning
request to change the zoning

312
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:22,862
on about 883 acres of land

313
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:28,580
for the Harriet Isle mixed
use plan unit development.

314
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,460
This will contain about
3000 residential units

315
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,127
and up to 190,000 square
feet of commercial.

316
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,817
The concept plan.

317
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,450
So the concept plan will be
divided into different phases.

318
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,836
Phase one will be the village center,

319
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:52,978
where the commercial will be located.

320
00:13:52,978 --> 00:13:55,010
There will be a small amount of commercial

321
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,843
in the amenity center that you see

322
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,246
on the north side towards the cove.

323
00:14:02,246 --> 00:14:05,340
We'll have an opportunity for small,

324
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,752
nonresidential as part
of the amenity center.

325
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:11,136
And then the rest will
be part of phase one,

326
00:14:11,136 --> 00:14:14,106
which is the majority of the residential.

327
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:17,010
As you can see from the concept plan,

328
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:21,882
there's approximately about
177 acres of wetlands.

329
00:14:21,882 --> 00:14:25,694
They'll be preserved along the
shoreline of East Lake Toho

330
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:30,111
and also with the cove where
Boggy Creek empties out.

331
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,920
In addition to that,

332
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,856
primary and secondary access
will be off of Simpson Road.

333
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:40,439
There will be emergency
access points only,

334
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:46,532
on Aurora Court, Borinquen
Drive, Hilliard Isle Road

335
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:47,980
and Crest Drive.

336
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,758
The emergency access points are intended

337
00:14:50,758 --> 00:14:52,086
for first responders

338
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:56,169
and emergency at those
points that you see there.

339
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,018
Some of the other amenities includes

340
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:03,350
as far as with the village center,

341
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,238
this will be primarily a series

342
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,350
of enhanced design guidelines

343
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,030
that will include street
furnishings, linear parks,

344
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:17,426
additional amenities to
provide a multimodal,

345
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:22,426
pedestrian, and pet oriented
design for the village center.

346
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,082
There will be a separate
developers agreement

347
00:15:26,082 --> 00:15:29,106
that the city will work with the applicant

348
00:15:29,106 --> 00:15:33,110
on the village center primarily to deviate

349
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,208
from the standards within this area.

350
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:40,198
The village center is proposed
to have private drives

351
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:42,228
and private access points,

352
00:15:42,228 --> 00:15:46,180
and this is going to be a
unique project with the city.

353
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,938
So to continue to work on enhanced

354
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:52,772
and alternative design standards
within the village center.

355
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:55,144
Now I do want to point out

356
00:15:55,144 --> 00:15:57,534
with that that there was a revision

357
00:15:57,534 --> 00:15:59,784
to the condition, that was,

358
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:03,336
you have a copy of it too, as well,

359
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:06,572
an underlying strike through
of the changes that were made

360
00:16:06,572 --> 00:16:11,340
from the previous original
publication to what we have

361
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,210
before you that we want
for you to consider.

362
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,386
In addition to that
with the revised agenda,

363
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:20,598
we did receive a public comment

364
00:16:20,598 --> 00:16:23,808
and like we normally do here,

365
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:27,168
I will go ahead and read this out.

366
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:30,668
We'll put it up on the screen too as well.

367
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,850
This is from John and Michelle Lux.

368
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,082
My name is John Lux

369
00:16:37,082 --> 00:16:39,882
and I'm a 25 plus year
resident of Osceola County,

370
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:42,436
the current resident of the
Hilliard Isle community.

371
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:44,292
Our family moved to our current home

372
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:47,550
to enjoy the rural atmosphere
that the community offers.

373
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,278
Our house sits on an acre

374
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,550
of property with just
17 homes on our street.

375
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,590
Behind us sits hundreds of acres
of calm, rural old Florida.

376
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,148
We notice it's inevitable
that the land is going

377
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:00,466
to be developed.

378
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:03,282
Our hope is that the land
will be responsibly developed,

379
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:04,476
not allowed to be more

380
00:17:04,476 --> 00:17:08,306
of northern Osceola County's
rapid overdevelopment.

381
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:09,922
We've attended previous hearings

382
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:12,076
and attended the most recent open house

383
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:14,288
where they discussed the long term plan.

384
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:15,552
There remains no plan

385
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:18,566
to deal with our already
overcrowded school.

386
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:22,716
We can't field teaching and
support staff positions already.

387
00:17:22,716 --> 00:17:25,348
There are no bus drivers
to transport kids.

388
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:28,068
Traffic is unbearable during the morning

389
00:17:28,068 --> 00:17:32,530
and evening busy hours, while
weekends are even worse.

390
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,018
Developers pointed to the
Simpson Road expansion

391
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:37,032
as a solution, but the expansion is

392
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:38,926
to deal with the current traffic volume.

393
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:42,232
The Hillary Isle development
will bring an additional 6,000

394
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:44,200
plus cars to Simpson Road.

395
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,128
I would urge you

396
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:48,088
to consider reducing the
new residents you allow

397
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:49,450
in the community.

398
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,298
Our infrastructure is not equipped

399
00:17:51,298 --> 00:17:53,890
to deal with additional volume.

400
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,198
We understand the plan

401
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:58,023
is to keep the lot 25 feet off the back

402
00:17:58,023 --> 00:17:59,981
of our current property line.

403
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:01,872
25 feet is not big at all,

404
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,246
so we hope that can be doubled

405
00:18:04,246 --> 00:18:07,579
so our rural county living is respected.

406
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,058
We also request that it be mandated

407
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:13,887
to be a natural barrier or berm,

408
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,938
with the trees and/or grass
between existing property lines

409
00:18:16,938 --> 00:18:18,330
and new developments.

410
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,274
We strongly request
that it not be a brick,

411
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:23,386
plastic wall or fence.

412
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:26,862
Even more so, we were told there
would be no through traffic

413
00:18:26,862 --> 00:18:28,600
on Hilliard Isle Road.

414
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,078
Please ensure that remains

415
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:33,022
and any request to
access a new development

416
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:35,390
through Hilliard Isle
Road is not approved.

417
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,380
Preserving the volume of
traffic on Hilliard Isle Road

418
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,250
and the offshoot streets
in our community is vital.

419
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,097
Those of us that live in
the Hilliard Isle community

420
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:46,738
are not anti-development.

421
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:49,202
But we urge you to respect
the current homeowners

422
00:18:49,202 --> 00:18:52,310
and act responsibly when
considering the new development

423
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,942
as we are all impacted

424
00:18:53,942 --> 00:18:57,550
by the decisions you make
regarding this property.

425
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,688
So I do want to point out,
as I previously mentioned,

426
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:03,605
that Hilliard Isle Road is supposed

427
00:19:04,804 --> 00:19:07,284
to be an emergency access only.

428
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:12,058
It's not a through road
for residential traffic,

429
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:16,596
it will only be for emergency
first response only.

430
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:18,362
In addition to Hilliard Isle,

431
00:19:18,362 --> 00:19:21,400
like I mentioned on the concept plan,

432
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,350
the other roadways will also be limited

433
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,924
to emergency access only.

434
00:19:26,924 --> 00:19:28,924
To address that concern.

435
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,578
At this point, I don't think there was,

436
00:19:33,578 --> 00:19:36,244
I don't have the applicant buffer

437
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:38,827
or a defined buffer of 25 feet.

438
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,782
We do have buffer requirements,

439
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:45,630
but this is single family to single family

440
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:50,130
so I can't speak to as far
as a specific buffer width.

441
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:54,858
And as far as with the school district,

442
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:57,828
school district comments
were included and they,

443
00:19:57,828 --> 00:20:00,833
I believe were in need of entering

444
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,634
into a separate mitigation

445
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,830
and to work with the
school district separately

446
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,752
regarding any type

447
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:11,335
of school mitigation
to offset the students

448
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,406
and the capacity of the existing schools.

449
00:20:15,406 --> 00:20:18,978
So it was reviewed by the school district

450
00:20:18,978 --> 00:20:20,882
and they did provide the comments

451
00:20:20,882 --> 00:20:23,426
that were included that typically

452
00:20:23,426 --> 00:20:25,586
with the school district
you would enter separately

453
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:28,300
into a mitigation
agreement with the school.

454
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,880
It can be a combination of land,

455
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,472
it could be a combination
of different things,

456
00:20:33,472 --> 00:20:37,889
but that will be handled
through the school district.

457
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,576
I also want to point out

458
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:48,354
that the applicant did
initiate a QA meeting

459
00:20:48,354 --> 00:20:52,949
with the surrounding
residents on October 16, 2023,

460
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:56,282
and as of the rerolling of our revision,

461
00:20:57,266 --> 00:21:00,832
we have not received any
additional public comments other

462
00:21:00,832 --> 00:21:05,182
than the ones that I
just read aloud to you.

463
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:09,030
At this time, with the revised conditions,

464
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,854
staff is recommending approval

465
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,687
subject to the revised conditions.

466
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,340
I'm just here to answer any questions

467
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,260
or clarification because,
as you know, it's a lot.

468
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,510
- Okay, board members,

469
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,719
any questions for Brenda for the City?

470
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:28,232
- I guess, first, a quick
clarification question.

471
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:31,400
When you were talking and
discussing the map here,

472
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,664
I think you said,

473
00:21:32,664 --> 00:21:35,326
what I heard you say was
that the mixed use area

474
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:36,459
was part of phase one,

475
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:40,042
but it's denoted in
the plans as phase two.

476
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,640
- It's separated out.

477
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,612
It is separated out.

478
00:21:47,612 --> 00:21:49,706
It may not be that map,

479
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:54,706
but it's a different map
that has the different phases

480
00:21:54,774 --> 00:21:56,990
of the entire project.

481
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:57,872
- Do you have a sense

482
00:21:57,872 --> 00:22:00,717
of the timelines involved
with the different phases?

483
00:22:00,717 --> 00:22:01,710
- No.

484
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,988
I mean, if it's the phase one,

485
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:05,444
we're going to assume that it's going

486
00:22:05,444 --> 00:22:07,466
to be the single family residential.

487
00:22:07,466 --> 00:22:12,450
But the applicant may define
a better timeline for you.

488
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:16,499
- Yeah, I guess, in terms
of a specific question

489
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:20,040
regarding the revised conditions
we just received today,

490
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,873
item four.

491
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,654
I guess I'm kind of confused

492
00:22:24,654 --> 00:22:28,478
because item three says specifically

493
00:22:28,478 --> 00:22:31,038
that the phase two multifamily
development standards

494
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:33,202
and the highway commercial
zoning permitting conditional

495
00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:35,740
use standards for
nonresidential uses would apply.

496
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,684
Whereas item four suggests
that phase two village center

497
00:22:38,684 --> 00:22:41,132
and any subsequent sub-phases
containing single family

498
00:22:41,132 --> 00:22:42,278
development standards must comply

499
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,694
with phase one single family
development standards.

500
00:22:44,694 --> 00:22:47,574
I guess I'm a bit confused
whether those seem

501
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:50,190
to contradict to my ear.

502
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,112
Am I reading it wrong?

503
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:55,338
- No, we're trying to pull up the map.

504
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:57,482
The standards were not included,

505
00:22:57,482 --> 00:22:59,690
so they were not included

506
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,290
for phase one transitional
A for single family.

507
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,940
So instead of modifying it,

508
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,504
we're saying that any of the single family

509
00:23:08,504 --> 00:23:10,808
in the phase one transitional zone will

510
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:12,814
just follow the phase one standards.

511
00:23:12,814 --> 00:23:15,678
So, different standards
for the different phases.

512
00:23:15,678 --> 00:23:18,056
- I can understand what you just said.

513
00:23:18,056 --> 00:23:19,176
That makes sense to me.

514
00:23:19,176 --> 00:23:20,188
But the item we have

515
00:23:20,188 --> 00:23:23,690
in front of us specifically
says phase two village center.

516
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,996
Any subsequent sub-phases
containing single family

517
00:23:25,996 --> 00:23:27,218
development standards must comply

518
00:23:27,218 --> 00:23:29,490
with phase one single family
development standards.

519
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:33,232
- And that's also the case for
the phase two village center.

520
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:34,848
So, two things.

521
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:38,982
Condition number three is that
any single family residential

522
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:43,373
in phase one transitional
area will follow,

523
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:44,706
sorry, phase 1A,

524
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:46,687
a single family

525
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:49,890
will follow phase one
single family standards.

526
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,372
Condition number four, phase two,

527
00:23:52,372 --> 00:23:54,904
which is a village center
for any single family,

528
00:23:54,904 --> 00:23:56,376
will follow the phase one

529
00:23:56,376 --> 00:24:00,230
because it was inadvertently,
it was omitted.

530
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,063
- Okay.

531
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:06,136
I guess I'm struggling a bit to understand

532
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:07,469
if this is just,

533
00:24:10,336 --> 00:24:12,706
whether this doesn't have any real impact

534
00:24:12,706 --> 00:24:15,381
or whether as read or as written

535
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:17,308
this might sort of undo
a lot of what I saw

536
00:24:17,308 --> 00:24:22,308
on the master plan regarding
targeting higher density

537
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:25,521
and multiuse standards for phase two,

538
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:31,462
because, as written, if
I read it too literally,

539
00:24:31,462 --> 00:24:33,972
it seems like it might undo some

540
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,868
of what I was seeing in the plan.

541
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:38,148
Unless I'm misreading it.

542
00:24:38,148 --> 00:24:40,723
I don't know if we've
made a comment from the.

543
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:41,898
- Yeah, for sure.

544
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,864
Specifically, single family residential

545
00:24:44,864 --> 00:24:47,531
in the phase two village center.

546
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,743
- Okay.

547
00:24:52,837 --> 00:24:53,928
Sure, okay.

548
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:55,352
So I guess I should read this

549
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:58,174
as that the phase one single
family development standards

550
00:24:58,174 --> 00:25:00,364
will apply only to the sub phases and,

551
00:25:00,364 --> 00:25:02,282
I guess sub-parts of the project

552
00:25:02,282 --> 00:25:04,386
containing single family developments,

553
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:05,682
but not to the whole phase,

554
00:25:05,682 --> 00:25:06,892
the phase as a whole.

555
00:25:06,892 --> 00:25:08,309
Is that accurate?

556
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:14,918
- The phase two, as it's developed,

557
00:25:14,918 --> 00:25:17,600
can be broken down, too, as well.

558
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,232
So we wanted to make sure

559
00:25:19,232 --> 00:25:23,716
to clarify that it will include
the sub-phases too as well,

560
00:25:23,716 --> 00:25:25,930
and we allow for that flexibility.

561
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:26,804
- Okay.

562
00:25:26,804 --> 00:25:27,637
All right.

563
00:25:27,637 --> 00:25:28,470
Thank you.

564
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,970
- Other questions?

565
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:41,490
If not, would the applicant
like to address the board?

566
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,756
Please state your name

567
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:46,173
and your business address for the record.

568
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:48,602
- Good evening.

569
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:52,685
Celia Dorn, 17 South
Orlando, Kissimmee, Florida.

570
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,726
I just want to address
some of the comments,

571
00:25:55,726 --> 00:25:57,917
and I would like to start trying

572
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:00,665
to help clarify that condition
a little bit for you.

573
00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:04,668
At this point, there's not
necessarily any single family

574
00:26:04,668 --> 00:26:08,170
that's being proposed in phase two.

575
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:13,170
What that condition does is if
those plans modify later on,

576
00:26:13,436 --> 00:26:17,516
it ensures that the single
family homes will match the rest

577
00:26:17,516 --> 00:26:18,732
of the community.

578
00:26:18,732 --> 00:26:21,932
So that's what that
condition is trying to do.

579
00:26:21,932 --> 00:26:26,123
I don't know if that
helps clarify it at all.

580
00:26:26,123 --> 00:26:26,956
- Sorry.

581
00:26:26,956 --> 00:26:29,131
Yeah, I do think that helps clarify,

582
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:33,108
but might raise a slight
concern on my part

583
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:35,636
of the committee in the sense that, well,

584
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:39,369
maybe we'll address this later,
but it's not clear to me,

585
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:40,202
looking at the plans,

586
00:26:40,202 --> 00:26:44,344
how much of this could change
from sort of the initial plan

587
00:26:44,344 --> 00:26:47,677
and whether the changes could constitute

588
00:26:48,723 --> 00:26:50,708
what feel like wouldn't be

589
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,296
in keeping with the comprehensive plan

590
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:54,616
that we're supposed to uphold.

591
00:26:54,616 --> 00:26:58,652
So to have the wiggle room
that what the park projects,

592
00:26:58,652 --> 00:27:00,828
it seems like is doing
the most to address some

593
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:04,444
of residents traffic
concerns now has a cause

594
00:27:04,444 --> 00:27:06,082
where it could be sort of undone.

595
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,082
It feels like a risk on the part of.

596
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,224
- I understand what you're saying.

597
00:27:12,224 --> 00:27:16,208
The actual density and
intensity cannot change.

598
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:18,160
So that is maxed out.

599
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,162
The number of single family
homes that they're allowed

600
00:27:21,162 --> 00:27:23,414
within the PUD remains

601
00:27:23,414 --> 00:27:25,812
regardless of if maybe some of those go

602
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,452
into phase two instead of phase one.

603
00:27:28,452 --> 00:27:30,132
So the ultimate number

604
00:27:30,132 --> 00:27:33,299
of single family homes cannot increase

605
00:27:34,346 --> 00:27:36,270
without a PUD amendment.

606
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,704
So I understand,

607
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:40,078
I think that's more kind
of what you're concerned

608
00:27:40,078 --> 00:27:41,854
about is more homes potentially

609
00:27:41,854 --> 00:27:43,998
or less commercial potentially.

610
00:27:43,998 --> 00:27:47,820
But those are why those
numbers would remain in place

611
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,852
and they wouldn't be able to do more

612
00:27:49,852 --> 00:27:52,043
than what those numbers are.

613
00:27:52,043 --> 00:27:54,444
- Sure, okay, I guess, yeah.

614
00:27:54,444 --> 00:27:58,192
For my own purposes, I'd be
concerned almost the other way.

615
00:27:58,192 --> 00:28:02,096
If the whole development just
turned into single family,

616
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:05,600
then I feel like that could
create much worse traffic issues

617
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,542
than if, as currently presented,

618
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:11,860
there was a multiuse core
that could represent a place

619
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,277
for residents to go about their business.

620
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,412
In the master plan,

621
00:28:17,412 --> 00:28:19,002
there's a place for a grocer

622
00:28:19,002 --> 00:28:21,879
and a discussion of allocating
a place for a school

623
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:22,712
and things like that.

624
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:26,470
- And that is certainly what the plan is.

625
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,536
This is a what-if
scenario that staff wants

626
00:28:30,536 --> 00:28:33,227
to ensure there is some
protections in place.

627
00:28:33,227 --> 00:28:35,686
- Got it, thank you.

628
00:28:35,686 --> 00:28:38,730
- On some of the other
issues that were raised,

629
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,370
I think the concern

630
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,698
of making sure that this
is responsibly developed,

631
00:28:43,698 --> 00:28:46,310
I think that's the whole
reason for doing this PUD.

632
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,864
It's being developed as
one cohesive community

633
00:28:48,864 --> 00:28:50,944
and a pattern that makes sense

634
00:28:50,944 --> 00:28:55,478
with various different
amenities and different uses.

635
00:28:55,478 --> 00:28:57,926
The commercial, the residential,

636
00:28:57,926 --> 00:29:02,130
the possibility of a school
site, if that's necessary.

637
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,732
Those are all things that are going

638
00:29:03,732 --> 00:29:05,140
to make it a community

639
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,998
that makes sense responsibly
developed together.

640
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,581
The traffic issues.

641
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,344
The applicant and the
city have worked very hard

642
00:29:14,344 --> 00:29:17,134
to be respectful of the
neighboring communities.

643
00:29:17,134 --> 00:29:20,798
That is why none of those other
roads will be through roads.

644
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:23,590
They will just have that emergency access

645
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,938
to make sure that traffic isn't flowing

646
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:29,362
into these more rural and
smaller neighborhoods,

647
00:29:29,362 --> 00:29:32,796
but instead will be directed
up to Simpson Road, which is,

648
00:29:32,796 --> 00:29:36,170
as we know, is a major
road within our community.

649
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:39,446
The 25-foot step back is a minimum.

650
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:41,648
That doesn't mean it
won't be more than that.

651
00:29:41,648 --> 00:29:46,110
That's just the absolute
minimum of what it can be.

652
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,496
We do have a presentation that we're happy

653
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:51,124
to share with the board if
you would like to see it.

654
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:54,378
It is very similar to the
presentation that was presented

655
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:57,818
at the future land use
and annexation hearing.

656
00:29:57,818 --> 00:30:00,050
That was a few months ago.

657
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,864
But we're also available

658
00:30:01,864 --> 00:30:05,110
to answer any questions
that the board may have.

659
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,026
- I'll ask the board,

660
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:09,276
would you like to see the presentation?

661
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,810
Let's just take the
temperature of the room here.

662
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,954
So it's being cold.

663
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:24,037
Who would like to see it?

664
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,656
- I think it would add context

665
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:28,892
to the discussion I imagine
we're about to have.

666
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:31,309
- Alex, you'd like to see it?

667
00:30:32,307 --> 00:30:33,224
No, no, no.

668
00:30:34,106 --> 00:30:34,939
Okay.

669
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,472
I had a question, what schools
currently serve this now?

670
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,070
Is this Gateway?

671
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,469
What are the elementary, middle,

672
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,102
and high schools currently serve this?

673
00:30:46,102 --> 00:30:50,185
- I believe that's in the
School Capacity Report.

674
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,751
- And I understand that's currently

675
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:12,274
that each year they
update and they look at,

676
00:31:12,274 --> 00:31:15,844
myself being part of a number
of redistricting committees

677
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:16,932
for the school district

678
00:31:16,932 --> 00:31:20,860
and chairing five different
school advisory councils.

679
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,068
My wife's a teacher,

680
00:31:22,068 --> 00:31:26,068
I'm very keen on understanding
the ramifications

681
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:28,872
to the schools.

682
00:31:28,872 --> 00:31:29,714
- Yes.

683
00:31:29,714 --> 00:31:31,692
- And I think we're going
to pull up the schools.

684
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:35,548
I will say the school
district has requested

685
00:31:35,548 --> 00:31:38,198
that a school mitigation
agreement be entered into,

686
00:31:38,198 --> 00:31:40,820
as Ms. Ryan alluded to,

687
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,237
and that would put into place

688
00:31:44,795 --> 00:31:48,900
ways to offset what this
development would be.

689
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,672
- And I do understand
that's under the purview

690
00:31:50,672 --> 00:31:52,746
of the school district to
work that out with you,

691
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,042
but I'd like to understand

692
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:57,625
kind of a 360 of the
ramifications of this.

693
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,092
- So, as they stated

694
00:32:03,092 --> 00:32:06,220
that they would provide
a more accurate report

695
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,832
as the development comes in,

696
00:32:08,832 --> 00:32:11,234
the site plan development comes in.

697
00:32:11,234 --> 00:32:13,576
So they did not have a traditional

698
00:32:13,576 --> 00:32:17,030
or standard school capacity report showing

699
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:20,776
how it would affect the additional
residential development,

700
00:32:20,776 --> 00:32:25,526
which facilities would be over
capacity or what have you.

701
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,160
They're deferring that

702
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,618
to subsequent site plans in the middle,

703
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,862
but they are requesting
mitigation at this time.

704
00:32:33,862 --> 00:32:36,198
So they did not indicate that to us.

705
00:32:36,198 --> 00:32:37,212
- Understood.

706
00:32:37,212 --> 00:32:38,858
Board, any questions?

707
00:32:38,858 --> 00:32:41,800
I'm sorry, did you have more
that you wanted to address?

708
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,545
- Not unless you want
to see the presentation.

709
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,378
- Okay.

710
00:32:44,378 --> 00:32:47,900
- Board, any other
questions for the applicant?

711
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,941
Go ahead, Alex.

712
00:32:48,941 --> 00:32:49,774
- Yeah.

713
00:32:49,774 --> 00:32:54,607
So do you have a sense of the
timeline between the phases?

714
00:32:59,285 --> 00:33:03,616
- Chris Ren, 4901 Vinelane
Road, Orlando, Florida 32811.

715
00:33:03,616 --> 00:33:06,735
Are you asking specifically
between phase two and phase one?

716
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:07,601
- Yeah, I guess.

717
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:09,056
I mean, I just, I wonder.

718
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:11,204
- Yeah, I wanted to clarify some of that.

719
00:33:11,204 --> 00:33:13,236
I mean, that's essentially
nomenclature that we used

720
00:33:13,236 --> 00:33:15,619
in the application to identify
the two different areas

721
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:16,515
in the project.

722
00:33:16,515 --> 00:33:17,348
- Sure.

723
00:33:17,348 --> 00:33:20,024
- So the phase one residential
is really probably going

724
00:33:20,024 --> 00:33:21,534
to be developed in eight phases.

725
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:23,144
Could be ten, it could be six.

726
00:33:23,144 --> 00:33:27,590
It's kind of a market
based decision at the time,

727
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,434
but you're looking at six to ten phases,

728
00:33:30,434 --> 00:33:33,436
probably over anywhere from 5 to 15 years,

729
00:33:33,436 --> 00:33:34,970
to be quite honest.

730
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,332
For the phase two mixed use area, again,

731
00:33:38,332 --> 00:33:39,842
that's commercial and multifamily.

732
00:33:39,842 --> 00:33:41,458
So, just speaking speculatively,

733
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:43,324
it could be two different
developers that come in

734
00:33:43,324 --> 00:33:45,692
at two different times
and build those out.

735
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:48,406
I mean, for the purposes
of our traffic projections

736
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:50,022
and the school board analysis,

737
00:33:50,022 --> 00:33:52,496
they kind of look at that as
like a three year build out,

738
00:33:52,496 --> 00:33:53,808
even though our project's really going

739
00:33:53,808 --> 00:33:56,324
to be much longer than that.

740
00:33:56,324 --> 00:33:57,684
And just to kind

741
00:33:57,684 --> 00:34:00,836
of elaborate on what Celia said
with the school mitigation,

742
00:34:00,836 --> 00:34:02,836
essentially we're agreeing
to every three years

743
00:34:02,836 --> 00:34:04,362
to reevaluate the impact

744
00:34:04,362 --> 00:34:06,244
that the additional
residential units are having

745
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,382
on the school board capacity.

746
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:12,712
So those mitigation requirements
could change over time,

747
00:34:12,712 --> 00:34:14,353
but essentially every three years

748
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:17,166
we'd be reviewing existing school capacity

749
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:20,472
and how many students our
new population is putting

750
00:34:20,472 --> 00:34:21,805
into the school.

751
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,596
Again, it's really market based

752
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,644
in terms of how fast
the build out will be.

753
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:30,082
But I would imagine you're going
to have both the commercial

754
00:34:30,082 --> 00:34:32,108
and multifamily moving
forward at the same time

755
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:35,630
as the single families moving forward.

756
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,824
As we look ahead, it's really a project.

757
00:34:37,824 --> 00:34:40,102
We've got to get environmental permits,

758
00:34:40,102 --> 00:34:41,366
we've got to get city permits,

759
00:34:41,366 --> 00:34:43,790
we got to get Osceola County permits.

760
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,952
So hopefully, sometime
middle of next year,

761
00:34:45,952 --> 00:34:48,022
we'd actually be able
to start development,

762
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:50,196
which probably takes nine to ten months.

763
00:34:50,196 --> 00:34:53,796
So you're looking into Q1, Q2 of 2025

764
00:34:53,796 --> 00:34:56,704
before you've actually got
any students being generated

765
00:34:56,704 --> 00:34:58,970
or additional traffic coming to the area

766
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:01,827
because of the commercial,
multifamily, or residential.

767
00:35:01,827 --> 00:35:02,660
- Okay.

768
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,493
Thank you.

769
00:35:03,493 --> 00:35:05,150
- Yeah, no problem.

770
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,238
- Question regarding,

771
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:10,440
I understand that Hilliard
Isle would be restricted to,

772
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,090
other than the residents,
restricted to emergency vehicles.

773
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,260
Would that also apply

774
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,060
to construction vehicles
going through there?

775
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,956
Construction vehicles would not
be going down there as well?

776
00:35:20,956 --> 00:35:21,852
- Correct.

777
00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:23,210
- Okay.

778
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,460
Board, any other questions?

779
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,152
If not, we'll open it up to,

780
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,272
unless you had anything else,

781
00:35:30,272 --> 00:35:33,238
we'll open it up to public comments.

782
00:35:33,238 --> 00:35:34,270
Was there something else?

783
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,992
- The only other thing is I
would request additional time

784
00:35:36,992 --> 00:35:38,783
to respond to the public comments,

785
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:40,204
if the board would allow that.

786
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:41,037
- Sure.

787
00:35:41,037 --> 00:35:41,870
- Thank you.

788
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,958
- We want to understand
clearly everything.

789
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:44,858
Public comments.

790
00:35:44,858 --> 00:35:45,763
Do we have any public comments?

791
00:35:45,763 --> 00:35:46,596
Yes.

792
00:35:46,596 --> 00:35:48,132
Folks, please, one at a time.

793
00:35:48,132 --> 00:35:49,306
Step to the microphone.

794
00:35:49,306 --> 00:35:51,256
State your name and
address for the record.

795
00:35:51,256 --> 00:35:53,423
You'll have three minutes.

796
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:56,932
- Good evening.

797
00:35:56,932 --> 00:35:58,996
My name is Dr. Brian Agard.

798
00:35:58,996 --> 00:36:03,406
My address is 2423 Aurora
Court, right off at the back,

799
00:36:03,406 --> 00:36:05,912
right where the development is proposed.

800
00:36:05,912 --> 00:36:09,928
We purchased this home because
of the rural atmosphere.

801
00:36:09,928 --> 00:36:12,968
And also we did not
want a large development

802
00:36:12,968 --> 00:36:14,393
behind our house.

803
00:36:14,393 --> 00:36:17,620
That's directly, so we have a
little over an acre as well.

804
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,566
I'm also a real estate broker over here,

805
00:36:20,566 --> 00:36:22,422
and I'm concerned about
a couple of things.

806
00:36:22,422 --> 00:36:26,636
Number one, I was hoping
to find out the mix density

807
00:36:26,636 --> 00:36:29,456
of single family townhouses

808
00:36:29,456 --> 00:36:33,123
and what the maximum
height will be allowed.

809
00:36:35,297 --> 00:36:36,905
- I can have folks respond to you,

810
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:39,013
but I just want to make sure

811
00:36:39,013 --> 00:36:40,042
if there's anything else you'd like.

812
00:36:40,042 --> 00:36:40,875
- Yes.

813
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:41,961
- They'll respond after your time.

814
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:42,794
- Okay.

815
00:36:42,794 --> 00:36:44,814
Also, if anything changes,

816
00:36:44,814 --> 00:36:49,358
will they allow our community
to also have approval process?

817
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:51,774
We don't want to have a
change, a last minute change,

818
00:36:51,774 --> 00:36:56,540
and some type of modification,
and we have no input.

819
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,630
That was my second.

820
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,980
So we want to have protections.

821
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,557
Also, we want to know
if we will have access

822
00:37:01,557 --> 00:37:02,984
to any of the amenities.

823
00:37:02,984 --> 00:37:04,418
Is there any way that we could go.

824
00:37:04,418 --> 00:37:06,696
They already addressed that
there'll be no traffic,

825
00:37:06,696 --> 00:37:10,870
no construction vehicles in
our area, which is great.

826
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:14,118
I just want to know if
you'll have access to some

827
00:37:14,118 --> 00:37:16,726
of the amenities and what's
going to be done for us.

828
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:18,876
For example, we have no sewers.

829
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:20,252
We have just regular sewers.

830
00:37:20,252 --> 00:37:21,542
We have no public water.

831
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:24,058
Is there anything going to
be done for our community?

832
00:37:24,058 --> 00:37:25,455
Those are my three questions.

833
00:37:25,455 --> 00:37:27,034
- Okay, thank you, sir.

834
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:30,378
We'll ask the applicant if you
would like to respond to any

835
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:32,126
of that, and then also the city,

836
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:35,150
if you have any response to any of that.

837
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,650
Whomever would like to address this first.

838
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,047
You could stop the time on that.

839
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,976
- At this time, they don't
have a full breakdown

840
00:37:46,976 --> 00:37:50,206
of what the single towns
and multifamily will be.

841
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:51,406
That's something that would happen

842
00:37:51,406 --> 00:37:54,380
during the site development plan process.

843
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,708
They do have the maximum density,

844
00:37:56,708 --> 00:38:00,720
but that can be distributed
in different ways,

845
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,137
and it will be market driven.

846
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,227
What is needed in the community.

847
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,743
As for changes, anytime
the PUD is changed,

848
00:38:13,406 --> 00:38:14,662
that will be done

849
00:38:14,662 --> 00:38:17,814
in a public hearing process
that we are in right now,

850
00:38:17,814 --> 00:38:20,558
that the neighbors would
receive notice for,

851
00:38:20,558 --> 00:38:23,720
just like they received
notice for this evening.

852
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,432
The development agreement
that is discussed

853
00:38:26,432 --> 00:38:28,522
and the conditions will likewise go

854
00:38:28,522 --> 00:38:30,538
through a public hearing process.

855
00:38:30,538 --> 00:38:35,455
So the community will always
have the ability to have input

856
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:41,177
into the changes that
would be brought forward.

857
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,022
- Brenda, does the city
want to respond to any

858
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,414
of those questions,

859
00:38:46,414 --> 00:38:50,000
or is that already
covered by the applicant?

860
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,010
- Yes, I think.

861
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:54,400
Was it the maximum height for phase one?

862
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,313
It's two stories for phase
one as proposed, two stories.

863
00:38:59,313 --> 00:39:00,146
- Okay.

864
00:39:00,146 --> 00:39:01,440
Thank you.

865
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,492
Other public comments, please
step in the microphone.

866
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:06,326
State your name and
address for the record.

867
00:39:06,326 --> 00:39:08,493
You'll have three minutes.

868
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,546
- Good evening.

869
00:39:13,546 --> 00:39:15,466
My name is Dr. Eugenia Agard.

870
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:19,006
I'm at 2423 Aurora Court in Kissimmee,

871
00:39:19,006 --> 00:39:21,923
and I have a great deal of concern,

872
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:26,968
because what I'm hearing
is there's not a lot

873
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:28,296
of concrete information

874
00:39:28,296 --> 00:39:29,938
before this can be approved

875
00:39:29,938 --> 00:39:34,170
in terms of what we are
approving, the structure,

876
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,930
what we can expect in terms
of commercial property,

877
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,218
strip mall, what does that
look like for our neighborhood

878
00:39:41,218 --> 00:39:43,602
and the changes for our composition

879
00:39:43,602 --> 00:39:45,392
and the way we live currently?

880
00:39:45,392 --> 00:39:50,392
Also, my concern is Simpson
Road is already out of control.

881
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,184
I can't even get out of the street now.

882
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:56,692
You almost have to make a right
turn just to go back left.

883
00:39:56,692 --> 00:39:57,802
It is terrible.

884
00:39:57,802 --> 00:39:59,210
It's a danger.

885
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,204
And so even though they're
saying they're going

886
00:40:01,204 --> 00:40:05,684
to use Simpson Road, I don't
feel that this is a good plan.

887
00:40:05,684 --> 00:40:09,860
However, the other
concern is they're going

888
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:13,278
to use the access road
through Aurora Court

889
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:16,606
and the other local ways,
which is the cul-de-sac.

890
00:40:16,606 --> 00:40:19,590
It's only one way in and one way out.

891
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,658
If that is the case, that
this does get approved,

892
00:40:22,658 --> 00:40:25,522
we need to ensure that
this can't be changed

893
00:40:25,522 --> 00:40:27,915
where there's some new
dynamic that comes in.

894
00:40:27,915 --> 00:40:28,748
Because we already know

895
00:40:28,748 --> 00:40:31,836
that people, legislation
has changed things

896
00:40:31,836 --> 00:40:34,396
after it's already been
approved and written in law.

897
00:40:34,396 --> 00:40:36,070
This will change our environment.

898
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,008
We have children.

899
00:40:37,008 --> 00:40:39,366
This is a thriving neighborhood

900
00:40:39,366 --> 00:40:42,960
and most of us move there
because we love the rural feel.

901
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,284
We don't want to feel
like we live in a city.

902
00:40:45,284 --> 00:40:48,909
And also, we have a beautiful
sunset in the backyard.

903
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:50,509
We may lose that, so I need to know,

904
00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:51,530
what is the buffer,

905
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,988
the buffer range from this property

906
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:56,740
if it is approved, from our property line?

907
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,010
We don't want to see these buildings.

908
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,318
I lived in Long Island.

909
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:02,232
I never lived in a city for a reason.

910
00:41:02,232 --> 00:41:06,082
I don't want to come to
Florida and live in city.

911
00:41:06,082 --> 00:41:07,640
It's just not good.

912
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,448
So I need to know what the buffer line is.

913
00:41:09,448 --> 00:41:10,878
Someone mentioned 25 feet.

914
00:41:10,878 --> 00:41:13,490
I'm sure it can't be 25 feet,

915
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,948
but I would like clarity on
what the buffer line would be

916
00:41:15,948 --> 00:41:18,914
from Aurora Court to this development.

917
00:41:18,914 --> 00:41:21,826
So we definitely want to be
involved in these meetings.

918
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:22,908
I couldn't make the last one.

919
00:41:22,908 --> 00:41:24,590
I was out of the country.

920
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,142
So I definitely want to
make sure we're involved

921
00:41:27,142 --> 00:41:28,406
in every capacity

922
00:41:28,406 --> 00:41:31,750
because this affects the
way we live in Florida,

923
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,568
which is why we moved here.

924
00:41:33,568 --> 00:41:34,528
Thank you.

925
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:35,790
- Thank you.

926
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:38,372
If the applicant would like
to respond to any of that.

927
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:41,463
- Robert, can I just jump
in here for a quick second

928
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:43,890
to clarify for the public?

929
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,142
I don't think I have to
clarify this for the board

930
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:47,640
because I think you guys know this,

931
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,223
but what we're talking
about now is zoning.

932
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,392
So in terms of.

933
00:41:54,392 --> 00:41:55,928
I understand the interest

934
00:41:55,928 --> 00:42:00,044
in what everything is going to look like

935
00:42:00,044 --> 00:42:02,940
and roads and stuff like that,

936
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,082
but anything that could even be offered

937
00:42:06,082 --> 00:42:08,882
at this point is preliminary

938
00:42:08,882 --> 00:42:12,908
and that's not under discussion right now.

939
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:16,012
So that level of detail and specifics,

940
00:42:16,012 --> 00:42:18,640
that's not what this hearing is for.

941
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,302
This simply establishes the zoning.

942
00:42:21,302 --> 00:42:24,596
And we don't have the map up right now

943
00:42:24,596 --> 00:42:26,916
of what the existing zoning is,

944
00:42:26,916 --> 00:42:30,416
but this essentially transforms the zoning

945
00:42:31,658 --> 00:42:35,722
and makes it into this
one cohesive zoning,

946
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:39,134
which is mixed use
planned unit development

947
00:42:39,134 --> 00:42:44,134
so that the developer can put
together a cohesive community.

948
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:48,937
So in many respects
it's a very progressive,

949
00:42:50,194 --> 00:42:54,361
organized way of planning
development in the city.

950
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:59,378
So I appreciate the
interest in the details,

951
00:42:59,378 --> 00:43:01,196
but we're just not there yet.

952
00:43:01,196 --> 00:43:04,950
And those specifics are
not under consideration

953
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,973
before the board at this time, sorry.

954
00:43:07,973 --> 00:43:09,089
- No, thank you.

955
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:10,134
Thank you for the clarification.

956
00:43:10,134 --> 00:43:12,246
Yeah, I understand these
are the broad strokes,

957
00:43:12,246 --> 00:43:14,816
but if I'm giving a chance
for everybody to speak

958
00:43:14,816 --> 00:43:16,612
and if the applicant
would like to address any

959
00:43:16,612 --> 00:43:18,212
of that to whatever extent they'd like to,

960
00:43:18,212 --> 00:43:19,662
you're free to do so.

961
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:21,395
- We're happy to not address that.

962
00:43:21,395 --> 00:43:22,228
- Okay.

963
00:43:22,228 --> 00:43:23,410
All right.

964
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,716
If the city would like
to address any of that

965
00:43:25,716 --> 00:43:28,816
beyond what Colin has already said.

966
00:43:28,816 --> 00:43:29,899
If not, okay.

967
00:43:31,205 --> 00:43:32,285
Other public comments?

968
00:43:32,285 --> 00:43:33,118
Yes, ma'am.

969
00:43:33,118 --> 00:43:34,286

State your name and
address for the record.

971
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:38,239
You'll have three minutes.

972
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,316
- Good evening.

973
00:43:40,316 --> 00:43:41,880
My name is Elizabeth Pimentel.

974
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,880
I live at 2685 Hilliard Court.

975
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,200
So I'm right off of Hilliard Isle.

976
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,178
I do have lots of concerns
about this project.

977
00:43:51,178 --> 00:43:54,736
We've been through many
meetings with these individuals

978
00:43:54,736 --> 00:43:56,840
on their vision.

979
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,090
Hilliard Court and Simpson is horrific.

980
00:44:01,044 --> 00:44:04,750
I've had to change my
actual schedule to work

981
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:08,400
because there is no way of
getting out of that corner.

982
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,218
You get behind that bus stop there.

983
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:14,146
The bus stop could not
even turn to get around.

984
00:44:14,146 --> 00:44:17,298
He had to go around the
AutoZone, the Dollar General,

985
00:44:17,298 --> 00:44:20,660
to come back around and block everybody

986
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,382
from getting to their
destination every morning.

987
00:44:23,382 --> 00:44:26,076
So it is something that, in your zoning,

988
00:44:26,076 --> 00:44:28,580
please take that into consideration.

989
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:32,352
There has been many talks
about expanding that street.

990
00:44:32,352 --> 00:44:36,415
It needs to happen before
anyone does anything

991
00:44:36,415 --> 00:44:40,560
because it is so dangerous in that corner.

992
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,866
All of these children,

993
00:44:41,866 --> 00:44:45,180
most of them go to that
corner by themselves

994
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,450
because their parents
have to leave extra early

995
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:51,636
to get in front of their own bus drivers.

996
00:44:51,636 --> 00:44:55,660
It is absolutely horrific
for the community.

997
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,216
My back is right to the farm.

998
00:44:58,216 --> 00:45:01,840
I'm actually the Luxus family's neighbor.

999
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,098
Been there about 14 years now.

1000
00:45:04,098 --> 00:45:05,908
And that is the major reason

1001
00:45:05,908 --> 00:45:07,816
why we bought this property in Kissimmee.

1002
00:45:07,816 --> 00:45:09,736
We could have gone to any other county,

1003
00:45:09,736 --> 00:45:13,516
but we came to Kissimmee because
we wanted that lifestyle.

1004
00:45:13,516 --> 00:45:15,692
I wake up every morning to that sunrise.

1005
00:45:15,692 --> 00:45:17,675
It's absolutely beautiful.

1006
00:45:17,675 --> 00:45:19,414
What they're planning to do there,

1007
00:45:19,414 --> 00:45:21,984
please take into
consideration with your zoning

1008
00:45:21,984 --> 00:45:23,258
because you'll have

1009
00:45:23,258 --> 00:45:27,098
so many disappointed
neighbors in this community.

1010
00:45:27,098 --> 00:45:28,440
Thank you.

1011
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,440
- Thank you.

1012
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,200
Yes, ma'am.

1013
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,358
- Just to address some

1014
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:36,180
of the traffic concerns
that have been raised,

1015
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,652
there is significant
improvements that are scheduled

1016
00:45:39,652 --> 00:45:40,670
for Simpson Road,

1017
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:44,462
including additional signals
which will help with some

1018
00:45:44,462 --> 00:45:45,986
of this being able to turn

1019
00:45:45,986 --> 00:45:47,672
in and out of these neighborhoods.

1020
00:45:47,672 --> 00:45:49,746
The county is working on that now.

1021
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:50,968
And the time frame

1022
00:45:50,968 --> 00:45:53,346
for those improvements should be done

1023
00:45:53,346 --> 00:45:57,762
before very much development
even occurs on this site,

1024
00:45:57,762 --> 00:46:00,614
as they're actively
building the road right now.

1025
00:46:00,614 --> 00:46:04,652
So I understand the
frustration with the traffic.

1026
00:46:04,652 --> 00:46:06,620
But there are preliminary

1027
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,942
and actual plans already
in place to help address

1028
00:46:09,942 --> 00:46:11,894
and ease some of these problems

1029
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,058
for the residents in that area.

1030
00:46:14,058 --> 00:46:15,058
- Thank you.

1031
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,369
Other public comments?

1032
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:18,202
Yes, sir.

1033
00:46:18,202 --> 00:46:19,312
Please step to the microphone.

1034

You'll have three minutes.

1036
00:46:27,566 --> 00:46:28,699
- Hello, good evening.

1037
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:29,992
My name is Gustavo.

1038
00:46:29,992 --> 00:46:30,890
I am also,

1039
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:33,649
I live at 2685 Hilliard Court.

1040
00:46:33,649 --> 00:46:37,080
I am directly the very last property,

1041
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,160
around the corner where the
construction is supposed to be.

1042
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,814
Question is that I understand,

1043
00:46:42,814 --> 00:46:44,788
I'm not quite sure about the plans,

1044
00:46:44,788 --> 00:46:48,926
but I heard 25 feet from our
fence to their next property.

1045
00:46:48,926 --> 00:46:51,502
I would like for that
to be maybe if they can.

1046
00:46:51,502 --> 00:46:55,138
They have a lot of room back
there to move it 25 feet more.

1047
00:46:55,138 --> 00:46:58,312
Maybe we can keep our privacy

1048
00:46:58,312 --> 00:47:01,440
which is the reason why we move there.

1049
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,288
It's still one of those few neighborhoods

1050
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:06,242
where you go in the afternoon,
but hardworking people go

1051
00:47:06,242 --> 00:47:08,582
and they put the jogging suits
and they walk and they run.

1052
00:47:08,582 --> 00:47:11,590
In the case of the bicycles,
we don't have any issues.

1053
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:14,285
There's don't been anything bad happening

1054
00:47:14,285 --> 00:47:15,118
in the neighborhood.

1055
00:47:15,118 --> 00:47:17,308
We're trying to keep it safe.

1056
00:47:17,308 --> 00:47:18,682
A lot of good people live there.

1057
00:47:18,682 --> 00:47:22,520
I understand that things need to develop,

1058
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,168
but it's unfortunate that
one day that beautiful logo,

1059
00:47:25,168 --> 00:47:28,040
instead of having a cow, it's
going to have a building.

1060
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,264
Everything has been built too accelerated

1061
00:47:31,264 --> 00:47:34,468
to the point that I've been getting snakes

1062
00:47:34,468 --> 00:47:35,971
and stuff that I never seen before.

1063
00:47:35,971 --> 00:47:38,094
Deers, I mean, they're beautiful.

1064
00:47:38,094 --> 00:47:40,544
But the traffic problem is another one.

1065
00:47:40,544 --> 00:47:41,518
On the way here,

1066
00:47:41,518 --> 00:47:44,882
seven and a half minutes
just to make a left turn

1067
00:47:44,882 --> 00:47:46,216
on the current condition.

1068
00:47:46,216 --> 00:47:49,010
I understand in the future
there might be another

1069
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:51,410
development of adding another line.

1070
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:56,327
But 3,000 properties, that's
6,000 cars on 42 feet of road.

1071
00:47:57,517 --> 00:47:59,196
I'm not an engineer

1072
00:47:59,196 --> 00:48:02,678
but I do appreciate that
they're going to hit it out,

1073
00:48:02,678 --> 00:48:06,858
they're going to keep it
as an emergency access only

1074
00:48:06,858 --> 00:48:11,000
so we can still keep some
type of traffic control.

1075
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,698
But I would like to recommend if possible,

1076
00:48:14,698 --> 00:48:19,698
instead of 20 feet from our
fence line, they add another 25.

1077
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:23,572
That will give us a
little bit more privacy,

1078
00:48:23,572 --> 00:48:25,086
which we have right now.

1079
00:48:25,086 --> 00:48:26,750
And that's it.

1080
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:27,950
Appreciate it.

1081
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:29,182
- Thank you.

1082
00:48:29,182 --> 00:48:30,868
I'll give the chance for the applicant.

1083
00:48:30,868 --> 00:48:34,201
If you'd like to respond to any of that.

1084
00:48:39,953 --> 00:48:42,588
- The 25 feet that was proposed

1085
00:48:42,588 --> 00:48:46,430
is what the applicant
needs to remain in place.

1086
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:48,320
As you can see from the plan,

1087
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,872
there's a significant amount

1088
00:48:49,872 --> 00:48:53,620
of conservation that is
going to be left in place.

1089
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,436
If you start changing
what those buffers are,

1090
00:48:56,436 --> 00:48:57,818
you potentially run the risk

1091
00:48:57,818 --> 00:49:00,930
of losing some of that
beautiful conservation land.

1092
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,804
So that is something to consider.

1093
00:49:02,804 --> 00:49:06,078
Also you'll see that there are trails

1094
00:49:06,078 --> 00:49:08,520
in the public right of
way along the mixed use.

1095
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,104
Those will obviously be available

1096
00:49:10,104 --> 00:49:13,836
for people to use to continue
to engage with this property

1097
00:49:13,836 --> 00:49:16,306
and engage with the natural surroundings

1098
00:49:16,306 --> 00:49:18,735
that the community is so fond of

1099
00:49:18,735 --> 00:49:20,642
in an even safer manner

1100
00:49:20,642 --> 00:49:23,690
than is currently available to them.

1101
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:24,690
- Thank you.

1102
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:26,912
Other public.

1103
00:49:26,912 --> 00:49:28,830
Brenda, do you have something?

1104
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,166
- I just want to clarify.

1105
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:31,680
There was something mentioned

1106
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,798
about doing the roadway
improvements prior to development.

1107
00:49:35,798 --> 00:49:39,268
Well, we and county can even address this,

1108
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:43,380
but even legally and statutorily,
we're not able to do that.

1109
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,478
So the best thing I would
recommend in that case

1110
00:49:46,478 --> 00:49:50,916
is to engage legislative
representatives to change that.

1111
00:49:50,916 --> 00:49:55,249
But we were not able to
delay or to deny development

1112
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:01,670
and have the infrastructure
put in beforehand.

1113
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:05,486
It allows them to do it
concurrently with the development,

1114
00:50:05,486 --> 00:50:07,670
but not prior to that.

1115
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,240
And as previously mentioned,

1116
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,367
that Simpson Road is a county road.

1117
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:12,450
It is phased.

1118
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,386
So right now, the first phase.

1119
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,892
You can also get more information
on the county website.

1120
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:19,600
I believe the first phase
is on the north side,

1121
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,310
closest to the intersection
to Osceola Parkway,

1122
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,776
and the improvements will follow

1123
00:50:23,776 --> 00:50:25,936
down suddenly phase one and phase two.

1124
00:50:25,936 --> 00:50:28,948
I believe this development is phase two,

1125
00:50:28,948 --> 00:50:33,754
part of the phase two
improvements for Osceola County.

1126
00:50:33,754 --> 00:50:35,412
There are plans, what have you,

1127
00:50:35,412 --> 00:50:39,082
that are available on the county
website to show the extent

1128
00:50:39,082 --> 00:50:41,170
of the improvements.

1129
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:43,720
I also want to point out on the land use,

1130
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,552
we talked about density
and those types of things.

1131
00:50:46,552 --> 00:50:47,768
If this property

1132
00:50:47,768 --> 00:50:52,024
or the seven portions of property
is annexed into the city,

1133
00:50:52,024 --> 00:50:54,328
and with the proposed single-family,

1134
00:50:54,328 --> 00:50:57,461
low density residential density,

1135
00:50:57,461 --> 00:51:01,698
the city has a maximum of
six dwelling units per acre.

1136
00:51:01,698 --> 00:51:04,890
If this property stays within the county,

1137
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:07,622
the single family low density residential

1138
00:51:07,622 --> 00:51:09,710
in the county is eight.

1139
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:14,627
So there is the potential where
the number of homes is more

1140
00:51:16,995 --> 00:51:18,054
if it stays in the county,

1141
00:51:18,054 --> 00:51:18,954
because the county allows

1142
00:51:18,954 --> 00:51:21,796
for eight dwelling units
as opposed to the city.

1143
00:51:21,796 --> 00:51:25,730
For us, it's six dwelling units per acre.

1144
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:28,244
And the surrounding property

1145
00:51:28,244 --> 00:51:32,827
and development being the
estate larger types of areas.

1146
00:51:33,822 --> 00:51:38,110
But that also with that density
of 812 volumes per acre,

1147
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:40,430
can green develop within the county

1148
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:45,290
for a much denser type of
development too, as well.

1149
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:46,558
- Sorry, Brenda,

1150
00:51:46,558 --> 00:51:51,100
but that's for single family
low density development.

1151
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,123
But isn't the thing
currently under discussion

1152
00:51:54,123 --> 00:51:57,956
is to mark this whole
lot as mixed use, MUPUD?

1153
00:51:59,869 --> 00:52:01,296
- That's the zoning.

1154
00:52:01,296 --> 00:52:03,296
So what we did on the land use,

1155
00:52:03,296 --> 00:52:06,672
the land use is separated
out that village center,

1156
00:52:06,672 --> 00:52:09,700
phase one, and that village center, sorry,

1157
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:13,650
phase two is going to be the commercial.

1158
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:18,042
- So today, 5D, we're
specifically talking about zoning.

1159
00:52:18,042 --> 00:52:18,932
- The zoning, yes.

1160
00:52:18,932 --> 00:52:23,932
We have already voted for
the land use, which is again,

1161
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,582
the yellow part is up to
the six volumes per acre.

1162
00:52:27,582 --> 00:52:29,390
The village center is commercial.

1163
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:30,950
The transitional

1164
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:33,986
is the multifamily medium
density residential

1165
00:52:33,986 --> 00:52:38,486
who has a density between
the 10 to 20 units per acre.

1166
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:45,202
It was part of the backup.

1167
00:52:45,202 --> 00:52:49,046
So the transitional 1A can
accommodate the multifamily.

1168
00:52:49,046 --> 00:52:50,784
That density is 10 to 20.

1169
00:52:50,784 --> 00:52:53,284
So we want for that to happen.

1170
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,450
- Do we have other public comments

1171
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:02,410
regarding this agenda item?

1172
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:04,810
Any other public comments?

1173
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:05,660
Another chance.

1174
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,930
Any other public comments?

1175
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:12,930
If not, board members, do we
have any motions regarding 5D?

1176
00:53:12,972 --> 00:53:13,922
- I'll make a motion

1177
00:53:13,922 --> 00:53:18,922
to approve 5D with its existing
conditions, 18 of them.

1178
00:53:19,221 --> 00:53:21,558
- Motion to approve, Robert Spalding.

1179
00:53:21,558 --> 00:53:25,958
- Can I suggest the
discussion before the motion?

1180
00:53:25,958 --> 00:53:27,878
- The discussion would
come if we have the motion,

1181
00:53:27,878 --> 00:53:28,896
and then if we have a second.

1182
00:53:28,896 --> 00:53:30,078
Then there'll be opportunity

1183
00:53:30,078 --> 00:53:31,706
for discussion prior to the vote.

1184
00:53:31,706 --> 00:53:33,373
Do we have a second?

1185
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:37,750
- Second.

1186
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:38,991
- Fatima, second?

1187
00:53:38,991 --> 00:53:40,142
- Second.

1188
00:53:40,142 --> 00:53:40,975
- Okay, all right.

1189
00:53:40,975 --> 00:53:42,372
Discussion, Alex.

1190
00:53:42,372 --> 00:53:46,205
- Yeah, so I guess I'm
struggling a little bit

1191
00:53:48,847 --> 00:53:50,274
with this one.

1192
00:53:50,274 --> 00:53:52,421
So our responsibility

1193
00:53:52,421 --> 00:53:56,740
on the Planning Advisory
Board is to withhold,

1194
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,430
to ensure that Kissimmee's
comprehensive plan

1195
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,763
is looked after.

1196
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:04,140
And one of the first difficulties

1197
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,342
is our comprehensive plan

1198
00:54:06,342 --> 00:54:10,378
really doesn't address
this part of Kissimmee.

1199
00:54:10,378 --> 00:54:12,906
This is a bit of an escalade,
but at the same time,

1200
00:54:12,906 --> 00:54:16,096
it represents a relatively
large proportion

1201
00:54:16,096 --> 00:54:19,386
of what will be the
residential stock for the city.

1202
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:23,252
So it's a little difficult
when the existing chapters

1203
00:54:23,252 --> 00:54:26,830
in the comprehensive plan
dealing with land use,

1204
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,163
transportation, walkability,

1205
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:33,508
the other aspects that we
are supposed to maintain

1206
00:54:33,508 --> 00:54:38,114
and ensure sort of don't
address this part of the city,

1207
00:54:38,114 --> 00:54:41,320
mostly because the bulk of
this lot was newly annexed.

1208
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,448
So that provides a bit of a difficulty

1209
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:45,058
for me from the get go.

1210
00:54:45,058 --> 00:54:47,186
But then, at the same time,

1211
00:54:47,186 --> 00:54:49,478
looking at the proposed master plan

1212
00:54:49,478 --> 00:54:52,310
for the mixed use development,
I do think that in general,

1213
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:54,406
it is in keeping with
Kissimmee's master plan.

1214
00:54:54,406 --> 00:54:56,396
There's a strong focus on walkability,

1215
00:54:56,396 --> 00:54:59,702
there's a strong focus on mixed
use, and trying to really,

1216
00:54:59,702 --> 00:55:03,898
it seems like, create a place
where the residents won't have

1217
00:55:03,898 --> 00:55:05,904
to get in their car and
drive down Simpson Road.

1218
00:55:05,904 --> 00:55:07,130
They'll be able to do a lot of business

1219
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:08,826
in the kind of core there.

1220
00:55:08,826 --> 00:55:12,259
And it feels like we're really going out

1221
00:55:12,259 --> 00:55:14,367
of their way to sort of address some

1222
00:55:14,367 --> 00:55:17,214
of the things that we
are supposed to look for,

1223
00:55:17,214 --> 00:55:20,140
given Kissimmee's current
comprehensive plan.

1224
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,798
But then maybe at the same time,

1225
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:25,500
it feels like in certain places,

1226
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,959
like I'm worried it almost
doesn't go far enough

1227
00:55:27,959 --> 00:55:29,317
to withhold some of the things

1228
00:55:29,317 --> 00:55:30,578
that we're supposed to look for,

1229
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:33,303
in particular, some of
the things we're supposed

1230
00:55:33,303 --> 00:55:35,665
to look for, like walkability.

1231
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:36,872
Like in extreme cases,

1232
00:55:36,872 --> 00:55:38,118
a lot of the things on the east end

1233
00:55:38,118 --> 00:55:40,449
of this thing are 45 minutes

1234
00:55:40,449 --> 00:55:43,116
from the sort of mixed use area.

1235
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:45,427
And then in particular,

1236
00:55:45,427 --> 00:55:47,068
the comprehensive plan
chapter which is dealing

1237
00:55:47,068 --> 00:55:48,939
with things like our
transportation network,

1238
00:55:48,939 --> 00:55:49,772
our busing network,

1239
00:55:49,772 --> 00:55:52,422
and things like that sort
of don't address this area.

1240
00:55:52,422 --> 00:55:54,448
And in particular, if
I understand correctly,

1241
00:55:54,448 --> 00:55:55,306
in the current plan

1242
00:55:55,306 --> 00:55:57,328
and the current set of things
we're going to approve,

1243
00:55:57,328 --> 00:55:59,392
there was a condition that
there'd be no bus depots

1244
00:55:59,392 --> 00:56:00,975
in this lot at all.

1245
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,309
I don't know if we'd get a clarification

1246
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:04,142
for that in a second.

1247
00:56:04,142 --> 00:56:06,566
I forgot to ask earlier.

1248
00:56:06,566 --> 00:56:07,582
On the third hand,

1249
00:56:07,582 --> 00:56:11,420
I understand that a lot of
residents have concerns.

1250
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:12,942
On the sort of fourth hand,

1251
00:56:12,942 --> 00:56:15,204
a lot of the residents who
have concerns aren't residents

1252
00:56:15,204 --> 00:56:16,872
of Kissimmee, but of Osceola County,

1253
00:56:16,872 --> 00:56:18,322
which makes it a little difficult, again,

1254
00:56:18,322 --> 00:56:20,146
because this is like an exclave property

1255
00:56:20,146 --> 00:56:22,813
as far as the city is concerned.

1256
00:56:24,379 --> 00:56:25,922
And then on maybe the next hand,

1257
00:56:25,922 --> 00:56:28,246
I understand that the purview of this body

1258
00:56:28,246 --> 00:56:30,182
and the thing that we're
actually discussing right now

1259
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:33,318
is a very inside baseball thing

1260
00:56:33,318 --> 00:56:35,653
of changing the zoning
designation of this property.

1261
00:56:35,653 --> 00:56:36,678
But if I understand it,

1262
00:56:36,678 --> 00:56:39,046
this is the last time this
will come before this body.

1263
00:56:39,046 --> 00:56:41,962
So this is sort of our
opportunity to ensure that,

1264
00:56:41,962 --> 00:56:44,122
as far as we can tell,

1265
00:56:44,122 --> 00:56:46,832
Kissimmee is in keeping with
its comprehensive plans.

1266
00:56:46,832 --> 00:56:48,010
So I guess.

1267
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:49,322
Yeah, I'm saying all of that

1268
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:53,629
because I wanted to kind
of get it out there.

1269
00:56:53,629 --> 00:56:56,020
Yeah, to summarize,

1270
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,710
in my reading of the comprehensive plan,

1271
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:00,788
I am sort of happy to
see that this development

1272
00:57:00,788 --> 00:57:02,158
in particular seems to go out

1273
00:57:02,158 --> 00:57:06,174
of its way to address a lot
of the concerns we have.

1274
00:57:06,174 --> 00:57:08,530
But then at the same time, part of it,

1275
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:09,922
I feel awkward about both,

1276
00:57:09,922 --> 00:57:12,199
because it is like
literally out of the purview

1277
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:14,402
and off the map for most
of the comprehensive plan

1278
00:57:14,402 --> 00:57:15,832
that we currently have adopted.

1279
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:18,569
And two, because it represents

1280
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:21,420
what would be a relatively large stock,

1281
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,446
sort of exclave to the rest of the city.

1282
00:57:23,446 --> 00:57:26,433
And I'm not sure the impact it will have

1283
00:57:26,433 --> 00:57:28,939
on the rest of the
things we need to ensure,

1284
00:57:28,939 --> 00:57:30,489
like transportation and services and parks

1285
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:31,322
and things like that,

1286
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:32,586
because it's sort of on its own.

1287
00:57:32,586 --> 00:57:33,434
So I don't know.

1288
00:57:33,434 --> 00:57:35,560
I wanted to put that out there.

1289
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,416
- So, one thing really briefly,

1290
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:41,892
and Brenda can probably speak
more to this in the applicant,

1291
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:46,225
but this is, because of the
magnitude of the project

1292
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:49,887
and the size of the property,

1293
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:53,030
it's a little bit circular.

1294
00:57:54,382 --> 00:57:57,250
So last time this came before the board,

1295
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,680
we were talking about annexation

1296
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,456
and a comprehensive plan amendment.

1297
00:58:02,456 --> 00:58:03,330
And in the part,

1298
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:05,860
you have to amend the comprehensive plan

1299
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,943
because you're bringing new stuff in.

1300
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:15,973
So that stuff is all changing
because of this development.

1301
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:20,012
So I hope that when you're considering,

1302
00:58:20,012 --> 00:58:22,280
how does this zoning,

1303
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,113
does the zoning follow
the comprehensive plan?

1304
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:32,320
Which is, what is your guiding
document to the zoning.

1305
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:36,073
I hope that you're
considering what you approved

1306
00:58:36,073 --> 00:58:37,580
whenever that was.

1307
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,754
- Yes, thank you.

1308
00:58:38,754 --> 00:58:41,550
- Whether it's codified or
not, because I'm sure it's not.

1309
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:46,038
- Yeah, I understand that
sort of technically we have

1310
00:58:46,038 --> 00:58:48,728
by annexing or already
approving the annexation

1311
00:58:48,728 --> 00:58:49,686
of the property.

1312
00:58:49,686 --> 00:58:53,397
- Because that stuff has not happened yet.

1313
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:55,112
- Yes, I understand that
will bring it officially

1314
00:58:55,112 --> 00:58:56,886
within the purview of
the comprehensive plan.

1315
00:58:56,886 --> 00:59:00,136
I guess my concerns are more subjective

1316
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,926
in the sense that the bulk
of the comprehensive plan

1317
00:59:03,926 --> 00:59:06,012
as written, like our
sections on transportation

1318
00:59:06,012 --> 00:59:07,546
and bus network and stuff,

1319
00:59:07,546 --> 00:59:10,112
generally the maps all focus
on the core of Kissimmee,

1320
00:59:10,112 --> 00:59:11,354
the sort of downtown area.

1321
00:59:11,354 --> 00:59:14,042
And there isn't existing services

1322
00:59:14,042 --> 00:59:18,944
of those types addressing
this part of Kissimmee.

1323
00:59:18,944 --> 00:59:21,646
And that makes it harder
to know whether or not

1324
00:59:21,646 --> 00:59:23,246
it's sort of in keeping with the spirit

1325
00:59:23,246 --> 00:59:24,829
of the existing comprehensive plan.

1326
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:27,329
That's what I'm trying to say.

1327
00:59:29,717 --> 00:59:32,066
- Right, my point only was

1328
00:59:32,066 --> 00:59:35,558
that the existing
comprehensive plan is going

1329
00:59:35,558 --> 00:59:39,391
to be different once
this is formally adopted,

1330
00:59:40,892 --> 00:59:41,975
codified, so.

1331
00:59:44,425 --> 00:59:46,675
- If it's formally adopted.

1332
00:59:48,879 --> 00:59:50,879
- I mean, this has been,

1333
00:59:51,729 --> 00:59:54,474
the annotation has been
approved by this body,

1334
00:59:54,474 --> 00:59:57,000
not by the city commission.

1335
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,794
- And to Alex's point with that,

1336
00:59:58,794 --> 01:00:03,794
as far as this being the final
spot here before it moves on,

1337
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:08,470
help us all understand the
process here after this,

1338
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:13,458
if it goes one way or the
other, where does this go?

1339
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:16,387
Does the city commission
then have a say so

1340
01:00:16,387 --> 01:00:17,862
on the next step?

1341
01:00:17,862 --> 01:00:18,695
- Yes.

1342
01:00:18,695 --> 01:00:19,528
- Okay.

1343
01:00:19,528 --> 01:00:20,828
- You're recommending,

1344
01:00:20,828 --> 01:00:24,400
you're providing a recommendation
to the city commission.

1345
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,680
- Got it.

1346
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,778
Just want us all to
understand the next step.

1347
01:00:29,778 --> 01:00:31,390
Okay.

1348
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:33,142
If it's approved.

1349
01:00:33,142 --> 01:00:34,241
Other questions.

1350
01:00:34,241 --> 01:00:36,070
- And then again to clarify,

1351
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:39,320
not to beat a dead horse, then that is,

1352
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,506
in terms of your legislation,

1353
01:00:42,506 --> 01:00:46,450
then this continues under staff review,

1354
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:50,645
multi-department staff review,
GRC for your site plans,

1355
01:00:50,645 --> 01:00:52,078
whether they're site plans

1356
01:00:52,078 --> 01:00:54,296
with the conditional use that may come up,

1357
01:00:54,296 --> 01:00:55,810
construction plans, with proper variances.

1358
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:57,443
- As it goes along,

1359
01:00:57,443 --> 01:01:00,762
it has to be studied and
approved each step of the way.

1360
01:01:00,762 --> 01:01:01,783
- Right.

1361
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:04,633
So when Mr. Ren says that this is anything

1362
01:01:04,633 --> 01:01:07,716
that's 5 to 15 to however many years,

1363
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:12,956
there's many years in which that site

1364
01:01:12,956 --> 01:01:16,848
and construction development
portion is going to happen.

1365
01:01:16,848 --> 01:01:20,931
So that's why I'm saying
this is very conceptual.

1366
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:26,750
I'm not trying to influence a decision.

1367
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:30,026
I'm urging you to think of it as zoning

1368
01:01:30,026 --> 01:01:33,693
and not as voting on a
specific development.

1369
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:35,693
- Understood.

1370
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:38,970
- It's tricky.

1371
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:39,892
- Yeah.

1372
01:01:39,892 --> 01:01:42,868
But I guess maybe to clarify for my part,

1373
01:01:42,868 --> 01:01:45,710
it's also true that a
particular zoning designation

1374
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:47,358
under consideration, MUPUD,

1375
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:49,045
is one of the most sort of permissive

1376
01:01:49,045 --> 01:01:50,312
under the current stuff,

1377
01:01:50,312 --> 01:01:54,390
in the sense that there's
more within the developer's

1378
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:57,690
kind of purview than would come before.

1379
01:01:57,690 --> 01:01:59,154
They're going to be able to make a bunch

1380
01:01:59,154 --> 01:02:03,530
of decisions without
seeking direct approval.

1381
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:04,990
- Not really.

1382
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:07,152
And if it makes you feel any better,

1383
01:02:07,152 --> 01:02:09,819
the city stands to gain as well,

1384
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:15,160
because there is the
potential for extra amenities,

1385
01:02:17,014 --> 01:02:18,726
extra concessions,

1386
01:02:18,726 --> 01:02:22,476
because it is a broader
swath that, you know,

1387
01:02:24,126 --> 01:02:25,334
right now we're talking

1388
01:02:25,334 --> 01:02:28,260
about what the basic entitlements are,

1389
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,678
but that doesn't necessarily
mean that the specifics

1390
01:02:31,678 --> 01:02:34,078
to how the development will unfold,

1391
01:02:34,078 --> 01:02:35,880
if that makes sense.

1392
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,297
It's set in caps,

1393
01:02:38,413 --> 01:02:43,413
but it's not mandating specific
units, locations, et cetera.

1394
01:02:47,353 --> 01:02:48,340
- We have spent,

1395
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:51,678
I think it's going to
be almost a year now.

1396
01:02:51,678 --> 01:02:54,345
So this is really not something.

1397
01:02:55,358 --> 01:02:58,402
We have numerous meetings,
and you're right,

1398
01:02:58,402 --> 01:03:01,819
mixed use PED is a lot of give beneficial

1399
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,450
and a lot of give and take.

1400
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:07,202
And so in my experience here,

1401
01:03:07,202 --> 01:03:10,452
it's perhaps only one other development

1402
01:03:11,436 --> 01:03:13,366
to take that a long time.

1403
01:03:13,366 --> 01:03:18,366
So it's been a lot coming
through, and even up to today,

1404
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:22,253
having to make changes
to present this to you.

1405
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,507
And then also,

1406
01:03:26,635 --> 01:03:28,543
I just wanted to clarify
a couple of things.

1407
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:33,194
I put on there the findings and
reasons on the staff report.

1408
01:03:33,194 --> 01:03:34,666
We have to provide that.

1409
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:38,612
So if we are providing a
recommendation for approval,

1410
01:03:38,612 --> 01:03:43,022
this is our findings
and reasons behind it.

1411
01:03:43,022 --> 01:03:45,236
And we have specific policies.

1412
01:03:45,236 --> 01:03:48,736
These are the ones here for the comp plan.

1413
01:03:49,678 --> 01:03:52,376
So we go through the different aspects.

1414
01:03:52,376 --> 01:03:55,736
It is going to be difficult
from a transportation standpoint

1415
01:03:55,736 --> 01:03:58,338
because the fact Simpson
Road is a county road,

1416
01:03:58,338 --> 01:04:00,130
it's not a city road.

1417
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:03,493
We're not going to have much data per se,

1418
01:04:03,493 --> 01:04:07,932
other than traffic impact
analysis that we require

1419
01:04:07,932 --> 01:04:12,020
or require for this magnitude that's here.

1420
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:13,187
And it's also,

1421
01:04:14,045 --> 01:04:17,078
there's so many goals,
objectives and policies, too,

1422
01:04:17,078 --> 01:04:19,216
as well, that we don't have a minimum

1423
01:04:19,216 --> 01:04:21,872
per se where you have to
meet this amount of goals,

1424
01:04:21,872 --> 01:04:24,618
of policies in the transportation
element because, again,

1425
01:04:24,618 --> 01:04:27,780
because of location, they
may be much more heavier,

1426
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:32,198
let's just say in the
economic or the conservation.

1427
01:04:32,198 --> 01:04:33,540
Conservation element

1428
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:37,070
for this particular project is a bit more

1429
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:40,560
where we can confirm that as
opposed to the transportation.

1430
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,584
Really briefly, bus depots are prohibited,

1431
01:04:44,584 --> 01:04:47,480
but that doesn't prohibit bus or transit.

1432
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,640
Again, with Simpson or with Lynx,

1433
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,582
there could be a bus
transit type of thing.

1434
01:04:54,582 --> 01:04:57,142
So it's not going to
prohibit bus transit stop,

1435
01:04:57,142 --> 01:04:59,783
but a bus depot where you have buses

1436
01:04:59,783 --> 01:05:02,069
that could be housed or stored.

1437
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:03,602
That's the intent of,

1438
01:05:03,602 --> 01:05:05,642
that not allow for something like that,

1439
01:05:05,642 --> 01:05:09,001
but absolutely to have
bus depot transit stops.

1440
01:05:09,001 --> 01:05:09,834
- Thank you.

1441
01:05:09,834 --> 01:05:11,509
- You're welcome.

1442
01:05:11,509 --> 01:05:13,250
That's all I have for the clarification.

1443
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:14,676
- I have a question.

1444
01:05:14,676 --> 01:05:17,918
Do we know when the first homes
were built in Hilliard Isle?

1445
01:05:17,918 --> 01:05:21,668
Just curious when that
was first constructed.

1446
01:05:24,905 --> 01:05:26,896
- I don't know.

1447
01:05:26,896 --> 01:05:28,101
- It says right now

1448
01:05:28,101 --> 01:05:30,276
I think there's only four
buildings on the property.

1449
01:05:30,276 --> 01:05:31,736
- The only thing I can tell you

1450
01:05:31,736 --> 01:05:33,384
in my prior experience

1451
01:05:33,384 --> 01:05:35,608
with the county is that these were part

1452
01:05:35,608 --> 01:05:38,270
of these rural enclaves.

1453
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:40,353
So it's not only the age,

1454
01:05:41,995 --> 01:05:45,010
but also the size of the lots.

1455
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:48,146
These types of rural enclaves
usually are state style,

1456
01:05:48,146 --> 01:05:49,394
minimum one acres.

1457
01:05:49,394 --> 01:05:51,770
But as I previously mentioned,

1458
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:55,026
that the county has changed the land uses

1459
01:05:55,026 --> 01:05:58,034
within these enclaves to
up to eight dwelling meters

1460
01:05:58,034 --> 01:06:01,094
per acre, so that they can redevelop

1461
01:06:01,094 --> 01:06:04,359
at a higher density than they are before,

1462
01:06:04,359 --> 01:06:07,230
that they are now, sorry.

1463
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:09,412
- I first lived in Kissimmee in 1986,

1464
01:06:09,412 --> 01:06:11,220
and I've seen a lot of changes

1465
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:12,996
and a lot of developments over time.

1466
01:06:12,996 --> 01:06:15,579
And I know that changes happen,

1467
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:19,578
but I certainly am
concerned about the traffic.

1468
01:06:19,578 --> 01:06:21,512
I'm concerned about
the schools, as I said,

1469
01:06:21,512 --> 01:06:23,966
with my own involvement with schools.

1470
01:06:23,966 --> 01:06:26,366
So I don't take any of this lightly.

1471
01:06:26,366 --> 01:06:27,783
Other discussion?

1472
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:31,383
No further discussion or questions.

1473
01:06:31,383 --> 01:06:32,699
We'll entertain any motions

1474
01:06:32,699 --> 01:06:34,949
regarding this agenda item.

1475
01:06:38,491 --> 01:06:39,974
- I'll make a motion to adjourn.

1476
01:06:39,974 --> 01:06:42,007
- I'm sorry, I want to clarify,

1477
01:06:42,007 --> 01:06:44,480
when you talk about the conditions,

1478
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,352
to make sure it's the revised conditions.

1479
01:06:47,352 --> 01:06:49,120
Just to make sure.

1480
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,788
Versus based on the revised conditions,

1481
01:06:51,788 --> 01:06:53,862
and to clarify your motion if it's based

1482
01:06:53,862 --> 01:06:56,620
on the revised conditions.

1483
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,504
- Say it again about
the revised conditions.

1484
01:06:58,504 --> 01:06:59,878
- The motion to make sure

1485
01:06:59,878 --> 01:07:02,656
whether or not it's the revised conditions

1486
01:07:02,656 --> 01:07:04,838
or the conditions that the.

1487
01:07:04,838 --> 01:07:07,616
- Or the original conditions, stating.

1488
01:07:07,616 --> 01:07:11,960
Okay, Robert, would you
restate what you just said?

1489
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:12,793
Okay.

1490
01:07:14,175 --> 01:07:15,008
Go ahead, Alex.

1491
01:07:15,008 --> 01:07:16,586
- I think the city is suggesting that

1492
01:07:16,586 --> 01:07:18,314
because there were
revisions that were made

1493
01:07:18,314 --> 01:07:20,526
after the agenda was sent out,

1494
01:07:20,526 --> 01:07:22,142
they would like us to clarify whether

1495
01:07:22,142 --> 01:07:24,478
or not we are making
a motion to approve it

1496
01:07:24,478 --> 01:07:28,525
as stated in the agenda or as
stated with these revisions.

1497
01:07:28,525 --> 01:07:29,512
- With the new conditions.

1498
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:30,345
- Yeah.

1499
01:07:30,345 --> 01:07:31,178
- Okay.

1500
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:33,868
Would anyone like to make a motion

1501
01:07:33,868 --> 01:07:36,118
regarding this agenda item?

1502
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,032
I make a motion

1503
01:07:39,032 --> 01:07:43,699
to approve this agenda item
with the revised conditions.

1504
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:46,773
Do we have a second?

1505
01:07:46,773 --> 01:07:47,606
- Second.

1506
01:07:47,606 --> 01:07:50,606
- We have a second, Robert Spalding.

1507
01:07:51,553 --> 01:07:53,019
We actually,

1508
01:07:53,019 --> 01:07:56,442
we had the motion previously,
and we had a second,

1509
01:07:56,442 --> 01:07:59,881
but we're clarifying this is
with the revised conditions.

1510
01:07:59,881 --> 01:08:01,547
Okay, restating.

1511
01:08:01,547 --> 01:08:02,848
So the original.

1512
01:08:02,848 --> 01:08:06,765
Let me go back, make sure
we have this correct.

1513
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:10,070
We had the original motion.

1514
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:13,480
Sorry.

1515
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,622
Because the original motion
was already on the floor,

1516
01:08:16,622 --> 01:08:18,152
and we had a second.

1517
01:08:18,152 --> 01:08:20,516
That's what we were dealing with.

1518
01:08:20,516 --> 01:08:21,433
- So for the record.

1519
01:08:21,433 --> 01:08:22,524
- My motion is invalid

1520
01:08:22,524 --> 01:08:24,235
because we already had
one and we had a second.

1521
01:08:24,235 --> 01:08:25,068
Is that correct?

1522
01:08:25,068 --> 01:08:25,901
- Yes.

1523
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:28,708
We're rescinding the first motion.

1524
01:08:28,708 --> 01:08:31,291
And reinstating a second motion

1525
01:08:32,366 --> 01:08:35,199
to approve the revised conditions.

1526
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,192
- Robert made the first.

1527
01:08:38,192 --> 01:08:39,712
I just want to get this correct.

1528
01:08:39,712 --> 01:08:41,854
Robert made the first motion, correct?

1529
01:08:41,854 --> 01:08:42,687
- Yes.

1530
01:08:42,687 --> 01:08:43,520
- On record, okay.

1531
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,353
- Yes.

1532
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:47,853
- And was, with the 18 revised conditions.

1533
01:08:48,698 --> 01:08:50,115
Okay.

1534
01:08:50,115 --> 01:08:51,610
- So it's the same motion.

1535
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:52,707
- It's the same motion.

1536
01:08:52,707 --> 01:08:53,540
Okay.

1537
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:55,620
And the second had come from.

1538
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:57,370
- The second came from Fatima.

1539
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:59,560
- From Fatima, previously, okay.

1540
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:00,393
All right.

1541
01:09:00,393 --> 01:09:02,470
And we have the discussion.

1542
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:03,847
All in favor, please?

1543
01:09:03,847 --> 01:09:06,406
With any abstaining, again?

1544
01:09:06,406 --> 01:09:07,239
- Abstaining.

1545
01:09:07,239 --> 01:09:08,381
- Abstaining, okay.

1546
01:09:08,381 --> 01:09:09,214
To clarify.

1547
01:09:09,214 --> 01:09:11,009
All in favor, please say aye.

1548
01:09:11,009 --> 01:09:11,842
- Aye.
- Aye.

1549
01:09:11,842 --> 01:09:13,969
- Opposed please say no.

1550
01:09:13,969 --> 01:09:14,802
Hearing none.

1551
01:09:14,802 --> 01:09:16,877
Motion carries, four,

1552
01:09:16,877 --> 01:09:21,460
one, two, three, four, five,
zero, with one abstention.

1553
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:24,670
Okay.

1554
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:25,503
Thank you.

1555
01:09:28,285 --> 01:09:30,838
Those are all the agenda items.

1556
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:33,686
Public hearings, any discussion,

1557
01:09:33,686 --> 01:09:35,790
here are the chairman and board members.

1558
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:38,304
Does anyone have anything
they'd like to discuss

1559
01:09:38,304 --> 01:09:40,387
or bring up next meeting?

1560
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:45,248
- As of right now, we don't
have any items for the,

1561
01:09:45,248 --> 01:09:47,472
I think it's January 2nd or January 3rd.

1562
01:09:47,472 --> 01:09:51,470
So I believe it's going
to be the the second PAB,

1563
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:54,070
scheduled PAB meeting in January.

1564
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:55,211
- Okay.

1565
01:09:55,211 --> 01:09:56,743
- Whenever it is.

1566
01:09:56,743 --> 01:09:57,576
- Anything else?

1567
01:09:57,576 --> 01:09:59,743
If not, motion to adjourn?

1568
01:10:00,785 --> 01:10:01,618
- Motion to adjourn.

1569
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:02,868
- Motion to adjourn, Diana.

1570
01:10:02,868 --> 01:10:04,398
We have a second, Robert Spalding.

1571
01:10:04,398 --> 01:10:05,690
All in favor, please say aye.

1572
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:06,523
- Aye.
- Aye.

1573
01:10:06,523 --> 01:10:07,704
- Opposed please say no.

1574
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:09,240
Meeting is adjourned at 7:12.

1575
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,907
Thank you, everyone.
