1
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,013
- Testing, 1, 2, 3, testing.

2
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:17,963
- Hello.

3
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:27,147
- I pledge allegiance to the flag

4
00:00:27,147 --> 00:00:29,122
of the United States of America,

5
00:00:29,122 --> 00:00:31,518
and to the republic for which it stands;

6
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,418
one nation, under God, indivisible,

7
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:37,350
with liberty and justice for all.

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,027
- Thank you, please be seated.

9
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:41,580
And I'm gonna ask
everybody to please silence

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,463
any electronic devices out of courtesy.

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,280
And we are looking at our minutes

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,310
from July 19th, 2023 PAB meeting.

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,310
Do we have any motions
regarding those minutes?

14
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,260
Robert, we have a motion to approve

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,880
and a second from Melissa.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,800
Any discussion, amendments, changes?

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,003
All in favor, please say, "Aye."

18
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:03,960
Aye.
- Aye.

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,980
- Opposed, please say, "No."

20
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,120
Hearing none, minutes are approved.

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,209
4A Old Business, public
care and conditional use

22
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:12,630
with site-specific redevelopment plan.

23
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,890
- Yes, thank you.

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,940
This is a conditional use

25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,100
with site-specific redevelopment plan

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,440
to redevelop the property located

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,380
at 51 through 53 West Pine Street.

28
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,093
This is gonna be on the
northwest corner of Main Street.

29
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:28,383
- I'm sorry, Brenda, let
me just jump in there.

30
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,690
Short term memory, sorry.

31
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,790
I wanna ask if any board members have

32
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,250
any sort of conflict of interest,

33
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,660
had ex parte communication,

34
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,706
site visits, discussions,

35
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:41,550
research on their own regarding
any of these agenda items.

36
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,010
And this one here, as
we are addressing that,

37
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,513
please let that be known.

38
00:01:46,664 --> 00:01:48,504
- I will for 5A and 5B,

39
00:01:48,504 --> 00:01:49,572
but I do not for this.

40
00:01:49,572 --> 00:01:50,999
- Okay. Brenda, go ahead.

41
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:51,903
Sorry.

42
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:52,736
- No, no worries.

43
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:55,080
So this is gonna be the
redevelopment of that site located

44
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,940
on the northwest, sorry,

45
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,730
yes, northwest corner
of Main Street and Vine.

46
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,350
This is gonna be a redevelopment

47
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,880
of a 538 hundred square
foot car wash facility.

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,940
Within your packet is a depiction

49
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,060
of the redevelopment of that site.

50
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,500
A bit of a background,

51
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,010
currently right now the property has

52
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,003
about a 3,000 square foot building,

53
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:22,320
a former 7-11, and also
a tenant space too,

54
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,780
located at 53 West Vine.

55
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,970
That was part of the approval

56
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,180
with the zoning being a mixed
use planned unit development.

57
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,300
This property, as well as
the property to the west,

58
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,840
are all part of the same zoning,

59
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,843
which is the Scottie's modification.

60
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:42,540
That was approved back in 1999.

61
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,300
Some of the recent changes
was with the widening

62
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,010
of Main Street.

63
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,793
It included, I believe, some improvements

64
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:52,626
to add the turn lane back in 2018.

65
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:57,390
That affected the existing improvements

66
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,740
on the 7-11.

67
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,720
So that plan, which is called a Cure Plan,

68
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,290
whenever we have
redevelopment that's affected

69
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,120
by any type of eminent domain,

70
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,310
or any type of roadway improvements.

71
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,250
So those modifications to
that site was submitted

72
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,440
and approved in 2018.

73
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,360
So fast forward today, that
PUD does allow for a car wash

74
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,220
via a conditional use approval

75
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,920
by the planning advisory board.

76
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,480
Within that car wash facility,

77
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,430
as known, includes a drive through,

78
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,890
which will consist of
the three lanes queuing

79
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,930
on the south side of the property

80
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,120
adjacent to Vine Street

81
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,070
and will move forward to the tunnel,

82
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,063
which will be oriented
towards Main Street itself.

83
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,720
It'll also include the vacuum
stations that you see there,

84
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,480
so that way customers,
after going into the tunnel,

85
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,034
will have had the
ability to use the vacuum

86
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:49,867
for interior cleaning.

87
00:03:51,237 --> 00:03:54,300
With that in mind, we have
been working with the applicant

88
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,810
because this is part of
the city's initiative

89
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,840
and goal to redevelop
the Vine Street corridor.

90
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,673
As you all know,

91
00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:05,940
in 2020 the city incorporated
the form-based standards,

92
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,660
form-based code, to actually
re-envision the Vine Street

93
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,490
to less of a auto-oriented,

94
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,070
but to include different design
and development standards

95
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,250
to make that corridor
more pedestrian friendly

96
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,190
and to encourage additional types of uses

97
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,980
to further redevelop both
the Vine Street corridor

98
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,900
and the downtown area.

99
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,250
So with that being said,

100
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,030
with the existing zoning
on the property being PUD,

101
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,710
we've worked with the applicant

102
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,020
to incorporate different design standards

103
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,110
that will, one, further the city's goals

104
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,460
for the form based standards,

105
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,040
form based standards
within the Vine Street

106
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,840
and the downtown area,

107
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,047
and to, again, further
redevelop this corridor

108
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:47,913
and this intersection in particular.

109
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,700
As mentioned in the staff report,

110
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,631
there will be some, what
we call, non-conformities

111
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,770
or existing improvements that will remain,

112
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,740
such as the south side
on the stormwater pond.

113
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,690
But for the most part,
as you can see here,

114
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,360
that the existing building
will be demolished

115
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,963
and redeveloped into the
layout that you see here today.

116
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,660
I do want you to point out
that within your packet

117
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,635
that you have hard copy,

118
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:18,090
I want to bring to your
attention that staff

119
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,930
with the publication of
this agenda included the,

120
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,763
was it seven?

121
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:24,780
Yes, sorry; eight conditions,

122
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,000
but working with the applicant,

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,790
there are changes that
you have for the car wash

124
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,140
that should be part of your packet

125
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,500
where there's a modification
to condition number one

126
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,980
and a modification to
condition number two.

127
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,720
All of the other conditions,

128
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,030
from condition three through eight,

129
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,410
will remain the same,

130
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,830
but we provided those
revisions to you via copy

131
00:05:48,863 --> 00:05:52,460
to you to see the changes to
conditions number one and two.

132
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,000
So at this time,

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,230
staff is requesting that you
approve this application,

134
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,080
conditional use request
subject to the changes

135
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,390
to conditions one and two

136
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,110
that you have included
provided with your packet.

137
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,250
If there are any questions,

138
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,820
I am here, as well as
we have representation

139
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,100
regarding the project itself.

140
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,560
- And board, do you have any
questions for the city staff

141
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,400
before I call,

142
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,930
ask if the applicant is here

143
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,033
and would like to state anything?

144
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,773
Please state your name and
business address for the record.

145
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,780
- Matt Britton, 3708 West
Lawn Avenue, Tampa, Florida.

146
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,789
We agree with all the
conditions that were stated

147
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:36,622
and here and happy to
answer any questions.

148
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:37,658
Thank you.

149
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:40,776
- Board, any questions for the applicant?

150
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,480
If not, do we have any public comments?

151
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,160
Any members of the public
like to make comments

152
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,213
on this agenda item?

153
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,660
Any public comments?

154
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,643
No? Okay.

155
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,200
Any discussion by the board?

156
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,610
If not, we'll entertain any motion.

157
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,647
- I motion to approve.

158
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:57,826
- Heard Melissa motion to approve

159
00:06:57,826 --> 00:06:59,520
and we have second from Robert.

160
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,798
Any discussion?

161
00:07:00,798 --> 00:07:01,631
- With the conditions.

162
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,030
- With the condition.

163
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,542
Melissa, with the conditions,
I'm assuming the motion.

164
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:06,690
Okay, all right.

165
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,648
- I'm sorry, with the modified conditions,

166
00:07:08,648 --> 00:07:10,045
number one, number two.

167
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:10,923
- Okay.

168
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:13,170
All in favor, please say, "Aye."

169
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,090
Aye, opposed, please say, "No."

170
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,530
Hearing none, motion carries.

171
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,363
Congratulations.

172
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,290
And five, New Business 5A: Public Hearing.

173
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,420
Again, I'll ask if any board members have

174
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,090
any conflicts of interest
with this agenda item,

175
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,410
had ex parte communications,

176
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,585
site visits, done any
of your own research,

177
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:32,179
please let that be known for the record.

178
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:33,826
- I have conflict of interest

179
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:35,370
and will be abstaining.

180
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,203
- Okay.

181
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,257
Yes, sir.

182
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:40,989
- Good evening.

183
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:44,310
Christian Arias, Development Services.

184
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,710
The applicant has filed
an annexation application

185
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,310
to annex approximately 556 acres of land

186
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,610
into the city, into the city of Kissimmee

187
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,760
for the project identified
as Taylor Aisle.

188
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,260
Before I proceed, if I
may, to add to the record,

189
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,810
there was a submitted
error on the public notice

190
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,120
regarding the legal description.

191
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,798
This has been corrected
and it has been presented

192
00:08:08,798 --> 00:08:09,813
in front of you,

193
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,196
and this has been provided to you

194
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:16,323
to compliment that error that was made.

195
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,190
Continuing with the site, subject site,

196
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:24,307
the subject site's actually
located, as we can see,

197
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,010
east of Simpson Road and west

198
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,210
of Lake Toho.

199
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:39,737
So, we can see here, East
Toho Lake, I'm sorry.

200
00:08:39,737 --> 00:08:42,420
As you can see in this map,
this is the subject site.

201
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:46,687
As part of this application,

202
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:48,900
staff and the applicant have had meetings

203
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,730
with the Osceola County

204
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,180
regarding this proposed annexation.

205
00:08:54,263 --> 00:08:56,700
The proposed annexation meets
the requirements set forth

206
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,500
by the local and state statutes
for voluntary annexation

207
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,330
as the property are contiguous
for adjacent to city limits.

208
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,671
To the northern side, as you can see,

209
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:09,573
it's abutting the already
annexed property to the north.

210
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,200
The development review
committee has reviewed this

211
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,200
and recommended approval on
March 21st of this year, 2023.

212
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:19,800
The first staff is recommending approval

213
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,290
of this annexation application

214
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,800
and this concludes my
report and I'll have...

215
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,066
If you have any questions, please,

216
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,367
I would be more than happy
to answer any questions,

217
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:31,670
or forward any questions
to the city staff.

218
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:33,971
If not...

219
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:36,415
I'm sorry, Alex, I apologize.

220
00:09:36,415 --> 00:09:39,560
There were also public
comments that were added,

221
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,770
as part of this application,

222
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,510
which will be distributed,

223
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,240
that has been distributed to you

224
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,240
and we have to identify and
also to respond to the...

225
00:09:49,795 --> 00:09:52,473
Do you have those in
the package, the uptown?

226
00:09:52,473 --> 00:09:53,970
- They have been included in the package,

227
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,200
as part of the package.

228
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,250
And it has been received
by the end of this day.

229
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,100
So that's why it wasn't added
to the original that you have,

230
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,009
but it's being added to
your packet as we speak.

231
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:08,306
Okay, Alex, you had a comment or question.

232
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:09,900
- Yeah, I guess I was just wondering,

233
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,136
looking at the planned annexation,

234
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:14,275
there's a little like abutment that,

235
00:10:14,275 --> 00:10:16,470
as far as I can tell, is
part of like Borinquen Drive.

236
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,075
I was wondering what the
purpose of for the annexation.

237
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:21,102
Is that just the
right-of-way in the street,

238
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:23,190
or is that kind of the...

239
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,896
- You mean the little sliver to the-

240
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:25,729
- Yeah, the sliver.

241
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:27,270
- That's a right-of-way,

242
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,707
but it's actually platted.

243
00:10:29,707 --> 00:10:32,327
It's part of the plat
part within the portion

244
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:33,630
of the property,

245
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,057
therefore it was included
in this annexation.

246
00:10:35,057 --> 00:10:36,831
- It was part of the original plat.

247
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:37,664
- That is correct, yes.

248
00:10:37,664 --> 00:10:38,664
- Thank you.

249
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:44,103
- Board, any other comments
or questions for the city?

250
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,350
I'm trying to find where the public...

251
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,573
I'm sorry, I thought.

252
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:52,318
I guess I misunderstood.

253
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,967
You're saying that-

254
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:55,315
(audience member speaking faintly)

255
00:10:55,315 --> 00:10:59,233
- Okay, where can we see those comments?

256
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:01,801
- It's just one email
that we received today.

257
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:04,767
One email that it's in the back of...

258
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:06,380
- We're going to read it into the record.

259
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,213
- I'm sorry, say again.

260
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:08,705
- We're gonna read it into the record.

261
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:10,165
- Okay, so we're going to hear those-

262
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:10,998
- Yes, yes.

263
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:12,645
- Comments tonight, okay.

264
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:15,233
- I'm going to read this into the record.

265
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,710
And this is from Lisa Gonzalez in email.

266
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,040
"In regards to the meeting today,

267
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,860
the letter was placed in
our mailbox yesterday, 9/5,

268
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,710
and not gave us much time to plan.

269
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,380
I live in 237 Aurora Court.

270
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,810
What is an emergency egress?

271
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,760
Will our area be considered city

272
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,730
and no longer county
when this is complete?

273
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,817
If so, are we going to have city water?"

274
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,153
I conclude that.

275
00:11:42,237 --> 00:11:43,070
(participant speaking faintly)

276
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,400
The answer to this email...

277
00:11:46,657 --> 00:11:48,870
"Lisa, unfortunately we
do not have the ability

278
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,730
to control the delivery schedule

279
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,460
of the USPS regarding the notices.

280
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,110
Tonight's meeting is the,

281
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,570
it's not the final
approval of this project.

282
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,870
The first city commission
date has not been determined..

283
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,870
An emergency egress is
a roadway that is used

284
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,009
for emergency services only.

285
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:08,620
It is not open to the
general public to use.

286
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,850
The annexation to the city
will only include the areas

287
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,770
highlighted within the notice.

288
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,660
It will not include your property,

289
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,990
but will include the
adjacent 32 acre parcel

290
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,790
at the end of Aurora court.

291
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,890
The city does not provide water services.

292
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,800
Those services are provided
by to Toho Water Authority."

293
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,420
That's the end of the email.

294
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,441
- All right, thank you.

295
00:12:28,441 --> 00:12:29,940
- Is that the only public comment or?

296
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,773
- That is correct.

297
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:31,606
- Okay, thank you.

298
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:34,530
Is the applicant here to approach

299
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,206
and state your name and business address

300
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:37,253
for the record, please.

301
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,590
- Good evening, Chair, commissioners.

302
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,570
Eric Raasch with Inspired Placemaking,

303
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:50,220
4767 New Broad Street,
Orlando, Florida 32814.

304
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,400
We are in agreement with
the staff's recommendation.

305
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,900
We wanna thank staff
who are working with us

306
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,733
on this project.

307
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,350
We've been working on
it for over a year now.

308
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,710
I do have a presentation, if
it would please the board.

309
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,840
Otherwise, we will be responsible

310
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,950
for answering any questions.

311
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,463
We want to reserve some time,

312
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:08,302
in case there are some
comments or questions

313
00:13:08,302 --> 00:13:09,448
that we can ask at the end.

314
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:11,177
- Board, do you have any
comments or questions

315
00:13:11,177 --> 00:13:12,677
for the applicant?

316
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:14,457
- If not-

317
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:15,290
- Yeah.
- Go ahead, sorry.

318
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,188
- I have one, I have one.

319
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:20,020
Is this a long term development or what?

320
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,853
- Excuse me.

321
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:22,020
- Is this a long term development?

322
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,610
- Absolutely.

323
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,929
- It is. Over a period of what?

324
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:27,079
- Oh Chris, Chris Pulti

325
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:30,300
probably has the best answer to that.

326
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,380
- Eight years.

327
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,400
- Over a period of eight years?

328
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,728
- Yes, sir.

329
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:34,737
Eight to 10.

330
00:13:34,737 --> 00:13:37,230
- And the city plays what part in that?

331
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,750
- So the city is responsible for reviewing

332
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,700
and granting the
entitlements for this project

333
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,834
to move forward.

334
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:43,710
This is just the first step.

335
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,650
So this is the annexation and
future land use map amendment.

336
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,170
We also have to do what's called
a planned unit development

337
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,210
and that's where you're gonna have all

338
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,810
of the design standards.

339
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,670
You're gonna see, you know, the setbacks

340
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,343
and the general layout of the community,

341
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,880
all of our proposed
landscaping, rights of way,

342
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,360
all of those details are
typically provided a later date.

343
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,410
So this is the first step

344
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,150
where we're just bringing
the southern piece,

345
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,970
which is outlined in red, into the city,

346
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,350
and then assigning a city
land use designation,

347
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,623
which is required to have by state law.

348
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,410
- I have suggestions.

349
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,243
Since you have a-

350
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:18,076
- Hold on, Robert.

351
00:14:18,076 --> 00:14:19,440
I'm sorry, Robert's Rules.

352
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,880
I'll go to the next person
and come back to you.

353
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,713
- Okay.

354
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:22,546
- Alex, go ahead.

355
00:14:22,546 --> 00:14:25,320
- I mean, I concede my question.

356
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,170
I'll let Robert follow up
and then I'll wait my turn.

357
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,220
How about that?

358
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,053
- Okay.

359
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:34,050
- Since your development is
over an eight-year period,

360
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,140
what stages do you
intend to develop it in?

361
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,280
- So the plan now is to phase it

362
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,120
and we haven't worked
through all the details

363
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,360
on the phasing plan yet and
which phases will go first.

364
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,130
But I think it's safe to assume

365
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,830
that it'll come off
Simpson Road and then go

366
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,113
from the west to the east.

367
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,600
- So if you develop it by stages,

368
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,580
you're going to have it open and available

369
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,880
to the public per stages
then, is that correct?

370
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,713
- That's right.

371
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:06,450
And yeah, I'll just add
that each phase has to stand

372
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,283
on its own.

373
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:08,190
So all the infrastructure

374
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,410
within each phase has
to be there to support

375
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,760
whatever happens in that phase.

376
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,340
You can't just put a bunch
of units in one phase

377
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,530
and then not build the roads, or not build

378
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,570
the required wastewater infrastructure.

379
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,640
So each phase will stand alone.

380
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,250
- And what if you fall behind a stage?

381
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,350
- I mean, the infrastructure
has to be in place

382
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,870
to support the development
and I'm sure the city,

383
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,740
I'm not gonna speculate,

384
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,530
but I'm sure they would
not permit us to go beyond

385
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,130
what infrastructure would allow.

386
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,849
- And you intend to put
how many units in there?

387
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:38,932
- 3000 units.

388
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,703
- Thank you.

389
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:44,562
- Yes, sir.

390
00:15:44,562 --> 00:15:45,550
- Alex?

391
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,304
- So, I think he said
he has a presentation.

392
00:15:48,304 --> 00:15:51,927
I guess I'd be somewhat
interested in seeing it.

393
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:54,363
So I guess I will move to...

394
00:15:54,363 --> 00:15:56,633
Will it require me to
move to subset the rules

395
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:57,545
to see the presentation,

396
00:15:57,545 --> 00:16:00,721
or can we just agree to
see the presentation, or...

397
00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:02,971
- To, I'm not clear what...

398
00:16:05,493 --> 00:16:07,620
- I guess I would like to
put it before the board

399
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,960
that we could decide collectively

400
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,872
to see the presentation
that the developer has.

401
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,429
- You can ask for that, sure.

402
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:16,882
- All right, could we
see the presentation?

403
00:16:16,882 --> 00:16:17,715
- Sure.

404
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:18,548
- Alright.

405
00:16:18,548 --> 00:16:19,631
- Does the board concur?

406
00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:22,050
- Also just keep in mind that, before you,

407
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,109
what you're voting on is the annexation,

408
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,980
not any details of this project.

409
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,672
- Not the actual project in front of you.

410
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:30,213
- Just to be clear.

411
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:31,046
- It's informative

412
00:16:31,046 --> 00:16:34,313
but this is not what you
should be considering per se.

413
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:38,121
Just does this meet the
standards for annexation?

414
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:38,954
- Understood.

415
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,590
This is a very limited
thing that we're doing.

416
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,180
It belongs to the county right now,

417
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,632
not the city, just to
clarify for everyone.

418
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:48,060
And what we're doing here is agreeing,

419
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,089
seeing if we want agree that
the city would annex that,

420
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:51,922
and that's it.

421
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:54,900
- And this is a voluntary annexation.

422
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,620
- Okay, so that's the scope of this,

423
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,640
is just, will it be
part of the city or not?

424
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,370
Not whether we like the project,

425
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,670
the roads, the lights, any
of that, just that piece.

426
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,940
So that is our responsibility
and our only authority

427
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,960
with regard to this.

428
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,580
Just wanna be clear.

429
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,633
Okay. That said.

430
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,215
All right, and thank you again

431
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:17,829
for the opportunity to
present this to you.

432
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,170
You know, we're all very proud of it

433
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,937
and a lot of work's gone into it, so.

434
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:23,640
And I know this is a pretty large project

435
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,100
and it's likely to garner
some public interest.

436
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,290
So we're really glad to
be able to explain it

437
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,123
a little bit more

438
00:17:29,123 --> 00:17:30,770
before you vote on your annexation.

439
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:34,770
So, I'll run through the location.

440
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,840
I'll talk about the
vision for the property.

441
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,469
We'll talk about what we're
here to debate tonight,

442
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:41,302
which is the annexation

443
00:17:41,302 --> 00:17:42,510
and the future land use map amendment.

444
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,550
We'll run through some
compatibility measures

445
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,943
for the project, and then
I'll wrap up with a summary.

446
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:52,380
So as staff mentioned, this
project east of Simpson Road.

447
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,964
It's on the northwest side of Lake Toho.

448
00:17:54,964 --> 00:17:56,190
It's the east lake.

449
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,253
The total project is 883 acres in size.

450
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,210
And we're proposing to
annex 556 of those acres

451
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,560
in from Osceola County,

452
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,270
They're currently unincorporated.

453
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,220
The piece from the north
has already been annexed

454
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,380
into the city and is
within the jurisdiction

455
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,780
of the City of Kissimmee.

456
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,940
This is our conceptual vision plan,

457
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,710
and typically you don't see this

458
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,777
until much later in the process,

459
00:18:18,777 --> 00:18:20,220
but you know,

460
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,440
we're running a lot of things
concurrent in this project.

461
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,740
So this is proposed to
be a mixed use community.

462
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,780
You would have 3000 dwelling units,

463
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,430
many of which would be single family,

464
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:33,450
which were located on the
east side of the site,

465
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,830
as you can see.

466
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,710
We're proposing 190,000 square
feet of non-residential,

467
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,050
and that would be in the
form of a mixed-use center,

468
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,060
which you'll see on the
frontage of Simpson Road.

469
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,970
So the commercial component
of it is really focused

470
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,840
on the frontage,

471
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,720
and then the residential
would be behind that.

472
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,180
We're proposing conservation
along the lakefront.

473
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,910
We know that the lake's
really a primary amenity

474
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,743
through this project,

475
00:18:54,743 --> 00:18:55,620
and I'll talk a little bit about a rec

476
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,960
and open space plan in a moment,

477
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,310
but we're also really cognizant

478
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,550
of the residential
immediately to the west.

479
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,130
And so all those arrows that you see going

480
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,080
into the existing
residential neighborhood,

481
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,880
those are proposed to be
emergency access only,

482
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,020
and as staff's explained,

483
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,023
those would be stabilized, sodded, gated,

484
00:19:14,226 --> 00:19:16,280
just to allow access for fire to get in

485
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,430
in case anything happens.

486
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,741
Our primary access is off Simpson Road.

487
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,574
You can see it to the north,

488
00:19:20,574 --> 00:19:22,930
just south of phase two with
the mixed-use community.

489
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,060
So in terms of rec and trails,

490
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,890
we're really proposing
an interconnected system

491
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,210
of open space.

492
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,040
You can see the trail network will run

493
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,860
throughout the community
and provide that access

494
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,950
to the area that we're
preserving along the lake edge.

495
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,730
We've got a number of smaller
parks centrally located

496
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,440
within the community to allow for

497
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,550
what's called a mused product.

498
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,980
This is an example of
that on the bottom hand

499
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,813
of the screen there.

500
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:48,810
That's in Baldwin Park.

501
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,840
You can see the unit front
on the central open space,

502
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,430
which allows for a sense of community

503
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,623
and allows for folks to gather.

504
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,820
Those units are accessed
to an alley in the rear.

505
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,816
So we're proposing the preservation

506
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:03,690
of the East Lake Toho shoreline.

507
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,390
We've got a buffer from the
single family to the west,

508
00:20:07,462 --> 00:20:09,120
and tree preservation's a big deal.

509
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,580
There are some really
beautiful old growth oak trees

510
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,040
on the site and we've
been fortunate enough

511
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,790
to appreciate and try to
match a plan around those.

512
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,290
So that's something that'll be forthcoming

513
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,780
on our future submittal.

514
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,600
In terms of access, this
is our road exhibit.

515
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,420
We've got, as mentioned,
the interconnected system

516
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,205
of streets, alleys and
private drive aisles.

517
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:33,243
We're proposing some emergency
access only to the west.

518
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,460
These are just a couple renderings

519
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,120
of what would happen
in the mixed use area.

520
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,120
You can see that there's a
number of different uses here.

521
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,210
You've got a central green
space around the tree

522
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,460
that's proposed to be preserved.

523
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,567
You've got some multi family
on one side of the road

524
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,310
and then you've got
walkable pedestrian urbanism

525
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,143
on the other.

526
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,190
So really trying to create a destination,

527
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,350
not just for the folks who
live within this community

528
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,453
but for the folks in Kissimmee as a whole.

529
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,750
This is just another perspective

530
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,440
of how the mixed use area would look.

531
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,280
This is looking towards
East Lake Toho from Simpson,

532
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,141
and you can see the proposed multi-family

533
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:15,741
in the back with the mixed
use area on the frontage.

534
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,210
So what we're here to
talk about tonight is

535
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,640
just the annexation and the
future land use map amendment.

536
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,620
This is the annexed area.

537
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,850
It's a pretty straightforward request,

538
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,190
556 acres going from Osceola County

539
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,080
to the City to Kissimmee.

540
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,040
And then we're also requesting

541
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,480
a future land use map amendment,

542
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,230
and that's a required map by the state.

543
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,380
You have to have a future
land use map designation.

544
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,440
Currently got a number
of different designations

545
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,540
and a lot of acronyms here.

546
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,403
But suffice it to say, the
portion in Osceola County,

547
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:48,210
you can see here on this chart,

548
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,990
has a low density residential
future land use designation.

549
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,950
And Osceola's density for that is

550
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,160
up to eight dwelling units per acre.

551
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,950
So if we multiply out what
we could do in Kissimmee,

552
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,920
what we can do under that
designation in Osceola,

553
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,220
we could potentially get it
almost 5,500 dwelling units

554
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,520
on the site under the
existing future land use.

555
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,020
Don't want to do that,

556
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,750
want to be fully within
the City of Kissimmee.

557
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,240
So that actually results in a decrease

558
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,850
of 2,493 dwelling units

559
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,590
for what would otherwise be allowed

560
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,030
if we went through the county.

561
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,950
We're also adding 190,000 square feet

562
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,600
of non-residential to support
those residential uses.

563
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,493
In terms of compatibility,

564
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,580
we're trying to be respectful

565
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,040
of the residential area
immediately to the west.

566
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,680
We oriented the non-residential
towards Simpson.

567
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,690
We're proposing the preservation
of those waterfronts

568
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,130
and wetlands,

569
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,830
and we're not proposing any direct access

570
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,890
other than emergency to the
residential that's existing.

571
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,900
So in summary,

572
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,340
we're really proposing a signature,

573
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,653
mixed-use destination
project for the city.

574
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,950
A lot has gone into the
vision and master planning.

575
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,500
You know, it's got three or
four different design firms

576
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,563
who've been working on this.

577
00:23:00,563 --> 00:23:02,664
We're only considering the annexation

578
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:03,497
and future land use map at this time.

579
00:23:03,497 --> 00:23:04,803
The PUD will come later,

580
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,950
and we feel it's compatible

581
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,550
with the surrounding area and
consistent with the comp plan.

582
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,630
So that's gonna conclude
my formal presentation

583
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,670
and our whole team's here for questions.

584
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,938
Thank you.

585
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,603
- Okay, board, any
questions based on this?

586
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,340
If not, we'll open up to any comments

587
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,682
from the public.

588
00:23:21,682 --> 00:23:24,390
Would anyone from the public
please step to the microphone.

589
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,010
State your name and
address for the record.

590
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:26,850
You'll have three minutes.

591
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,356
We'll get to one at at time.

592
00:23:28,356 --> 00:23:29,331
Please, I'm sorry, sir.

593
00:23:29,331 --> 00:23:30,421
Sir, I saw the...

594
00:23:30,421 --> 00:23:32,648
Oh, okay, I just saw your hand up first.

595
00:23:32,648 --> 00:23:34,821
So wanna go in order.

596
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:35,854
That's totally fine.

597
00:23:35,854 --> 00:23:38,113
I just saw her hand up first, so.

598
00:23:38,113 --> 00:23:40,024
Go right ahead.

599
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:41,940
State your name and address
for the record, please.

600
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,934
You'll have three minutes.

601
00:23:42,934 --> 00:23:45,269
- My name is Tony Samota and I live

602
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:48,436
at 1730 Lee Janzen Drive in Kissimmee.

603
00:23:50,027 --> 00:23:51,670
It was a great presentation

604
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,900
but I also live just south.

605
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,740
I appreciated the applicant's
desire to make sure

606
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,537
that the residents on the
west side were taken care of.

607
00:24:01,537 --> 00:24:04,230
But those of us to the south that live

608
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:07,920
in Kissimmee Bay also has some concerns

609
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,503
because after Hurricane Ian,

610
00:24:10,503 --> 00:24:12,059
our neighborhood flooded

611
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:15,060
and we have flood water in
our neighborhood for days.

612
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,720
And so there is Oxbow
Pond which is just south

613
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,340
of this site,

614
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,562
and I'm concerned as
to go on the record of,

615
00:24:24,562 --> 00:24:28,080
in terms of runoff and still
in terms of our neighborhood,

616
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,623
because we definitely
have had to deal lately

617
00:24:30,623 --> 00:24:34,140
with water and flooding in our area.

618
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,463
So, I know this meeting isn't
about the final part of it,

619
00:24:39,448 --> 00:24:41,838
but I just wanted to be
on the record to say,

620
00:24:41,838 --> 00:24:44,146
those of us to the
south are very concerned

621
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:47,520
that this development
would add to the problems

622
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,350
with flooding in our neighborhood.

623
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,183
Thank you.

624
00:24:50,183 --> 00:24:51,270
- Thank you.

625
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,510
Next up, please step to the microphone.

626
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,710
State your name and
address for the record.

627
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,993
You'll have three minutes.

628
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,310
- Hi, so I'm Lisa Gonzalez.

629
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,300
I was the one that sent the email,

630
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,220
so thank you for responding.

631
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,380
So I'm actually on the west side,

632
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,480
so really on the bottom part.

633
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,020
- I'm sorry, did you state your address?

634
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,087
- 2372 Aurora Court.

635
00:25:10,087 --> 00:25:10,920
- Thanks.

636
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,953
- So I'm right there, right
on the corner, left side.

637
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,610
So the question about
the emergency egress,

638
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,193
that was already answered, so that's good.

639
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,480
So really what I'm
concerned about right now,

640
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,190
not only the flooding as well,

641
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,895
like the gentleman over here just said,

642
00:25:27,895 --> 00:25:31,080
but also if we're county in the middle

643
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,693
and then this site becomes city,

644
00:25:33,693 --> 00:25:36,363
does that affect us in any way?

645
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:39,416
I'm not sure if this is
the right forum or not.

646
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:40,249
- Just to explain,

647
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:41,910
this is your time to make
your comments, whatever,

648
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:42,840
and then we'll discuss.

649
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,400
If we have questions
based on your comments,

650
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,233
we can address the city

651
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:46,530
but this is your time to-

652
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,260
- Yeah, that's really
my concern right now,

653
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,173
besides the emergency
exits and things like that.

654
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:54,180
- Okay, thank you.

655
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,560
Do we have other public comments.

656
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,000
Yes, sir, just step to
the microphone please.

657
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,170
State your name and your address.

658
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,470
You'll have three minutes.

659
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,065
I don't, I don't know.

660
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:08,982
(participant faintly speaking)

661
00:26:11,165 --> 00:26:12,360
- Makes it kind of difficult.

662
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,021
Looks small, doesn't it?

663
00:26:14,021 --> 00:26:16,082
Nice presentation, though, by the way.

664
00:26:16,082 --> 00:26:18,190
It looks kind of small,
but it's a huge area,

665
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,510
an area that I've lived in for a long time

666
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,674
and I can't direct anything.

667
00:26:22,674 --> 00:26:23,507
- What's your address, sir?

668
00:26:23,507 --> 00:26:24,707
Your name and your address.

669
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:25,745
- My name is Thomas Vossick.

670
00:26:25,745 --> 00:26:27,900
I live in 2620 Cahokia Court,

671
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,064
which is again, I could
point out in the region,

672
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:35,731
but you see where the
Hilliard Isle Road is,

673
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,880
that's what I'll be referring to

674
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,347
when I use up my three
minutes here in a moment.

675
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:48,729
If she can.

676
00:26:48,729 --> 00:26:49,950
If she can't, I'll go ahead.

677
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:53,607
But thank you for letting
speak this evening.

678
00:26:53,607 --> 00:26:57,240
You know where the Hilliard
Isle project is being located.

679
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,610
Some of you have lived
here for a long time,

680
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,593
maybe most of your lives, like myself,

681
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,700
and as you discuss this
develop in this rural area,

682
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,100
please consider these facts.

683
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:13,190
Hilliard Isle is a short,
barely two lane, country road.

684
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,770
It is a county road,

685
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,530
but it's our only access to Simpson Road

686
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,120
and out of our neighborhoods.

687
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,380
So these homes directly to the west are

688
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,480
what I'm referring to.

689
00:27:28,955 --> 00:27:31,650
Looks like they've almost got it here.

690
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,200
It's already dangerously congested

691
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,780
and it's not signalized at Hilliard Isle

692
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,430
when we exit out onto Simpson Road,

693
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,950
which was previously Bobby Creek.

694
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,780
The city council previously approved

695
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,620
a multi-family development
in 2023 on Hilliard Isle.

696
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,060
I don't know if you're aware of that,

697
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,051
or if you're keeping that in mind

698
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:51,630
when you consider this development,

699
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,570
which will add an additional
300 cars on the road

700
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,187
and it's not yet started construction.

701
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,855
Where is that located?

702
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:04,143
In that area just above the word Hilliard.

703
00:28:05,496 --> 00:28:09,453
That's where that development is going in.

704
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:11,970
It's not yet started construction.

705
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,190
Today's proposed development
would force thousands

706
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,500
of extra vehicles onto Hilliard Isle,

707
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,930
this narrow country road.

708
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,450
This area has gone through the county

709
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,200
and through the city multiple times

710
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,120
and we've been told different things

711
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,910
through those different evolutions.

712
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,810
But these people that
are living miles down

713
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,670
in the subject site are
not going to drive three

714
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,050
or four miles up

715
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,760
through the other proposed development

716
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,699
that's north of it to
go out to Simpson Road.

717
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:43,340
We've always been told,

718
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,940
and this is the first time that I've heard

719
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,840
and I've lived in my home
there for almost 27 years,

720
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,587
this is the first time we've been told,

721
00:28:50,587 --> 00:28:52,860
"Hilliard Isle won't be used."

722
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,113
Can't get it to get up there?

723
00:28:57,454 --> 00:28:58,770
Hilliard Isle is the only road

724
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,840
that goes all the way into that section.

725
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,720
There are no other roads
that go into that area.

726
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,270
It starts on Simpson and
goes straight through

727
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,340
and it dead ends right there.

728
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,810
Anything that's constructed,

729
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,300
all of the construction vehicles,
anything that's happening,

730
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,520
will be going up and down
our little country road,

731
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,320
and if you've live here, you
know what I'm referring to.

732
00:29:19,347 --> 00:29:20,280
They assured,

733
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,603
the city council assured our
community in February of 2023,

734
00:29:24,603 --> 00:29:26,070
that the Simpson Road
construction improvements

735
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,560
would be completed by August of 2024.

736
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,110
As you know in that
area, they're not begun.

737
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,290
Those improvements have
not only been not begun,

738
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,390
but they're nowhere near our area.

739
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,780
They're struggling with that
north end of Bobby Creek.

740
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,510
The infrastructure was not
in place then, nor is it now.

741
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,370
Road construction is already years

742
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,290
behind construction schedule.

743
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,112
Massive funding shortages
are just one of those issues

744
00:29:49,112 --> 00:29:50,580
for those delays.

745
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,480
This isn't a race, it's not about,

746
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,311
it's not about the need for low, middle,

747
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:57,390
or high income housing at this moment.

748
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,130
This is about repeatedly rushing ahead

749
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,260
without considering the
long-term consequences

750
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,767
on the existing area.

751
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,821
We have to do better than that.

752
00:30:04,821 --> 00:30:06,389
I'm aware of the state,

753
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:08,730
that the state law
suggests that if funding

754
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,300
for an infrastructure
improvement has been approved,

755
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,000
those improvements are to
be considered completed

756
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,440
before they've even been begun.

757
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,246
I was shocked to hear that at
the last city council meeting,

758
00:30:20,246 --> 00:30:23,340
by the city council and the developer.

759
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,590
We all know this benefits
only the contractors

760
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,940
and the construction companies,

761
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,823
and speaks more to land
abuse than good use.

762
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,970
Please encourage the
council to put the brakes

763
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,230
on this huge development,

764
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,110
at least until the
infrastructure is in place

765
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,733
to ensure everyone's safety.

766
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,703
Thank you.

767
00:30:41,825 --> 00:30:42,700
- Thank you.

768
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,280
Do we have other public comments?

769
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,990
Anyone else from the public
like to make comment?

770
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,040
Any other public comments?

771
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,533
If not, board, do you have any questions?

772
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,233
- No.

773
00:30:54,233 --> 00:30:55,500
- Comments to staff?

774
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,333
Yes ma'am.

775
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:57,245
- If we could just-

776
00:30:57,245 --> 00:30:58,470
- Could you state your name
and address for the record?

777
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,413
Who are you?

778
00:30:59,413 --> 00:31:01,563
- Yes, Cecelia Dorn, 17 South Orlando,

779
00:31:01,563 --> 00:31:03,000
Kissimmee, Florida 34741.

780
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,080
I'm here with the developer.

781
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,630
If we could answer or respond
to some of the comments

782
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,933
that were made, we would appreciate that.

783
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,945
- Yeah, we'll allow that.

784
00:31:12,945 --> 00:31:13,778
Go ahead.

785
00:31:13,778 --> 00:31:14,823
- Great, thank you.

786
00:31:14,823 --> 00:31:17,493
- Let's hear everything.

787
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:21,720
- Just to address the initial
concerns about annexation for

788
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,280
other properties, it should have no impact

789
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,430
on your home unless you want it to.

790
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,141
- Ma'am, please address your
comments to the board here.

791
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:31,974
- Okay.

792
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,360
It should have no impact on the homes

793
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,880
of the other individuals
that live in that area,

794
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,880
unless they file their
own voluntary annexation

795
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,040
or the city of Kissimmee decides

796
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,260
to file an involuntary annexation.

797
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,673
So, it would not have any
impact on the surrounding homes.

798
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,650
To address the concerns
about infrastructure

799
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,763
not being in place.

800
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:54,330
The soonest that construction
would potentially begin

801
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,820
on this site would be midyear next year.

802
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,350
Again, there are a lot of approvals

803
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,340
that would need to happen

804
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,460
before any construction
could begin on this site.

805
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,340
And even then, there would
be an another 18-month lag

806
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,850
before anyone lived in this development.

807
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,880
Simpson Road improvements would
be complete at that point.

808
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,080
Any improvements to the
infrastructure would be required

809
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,490
to be complete before the
development is finished

810
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:20,402
and anyone could move
in within that phase.

811
00:32:20,402 --> 00:32:24,570
Also, the issue with the Hilliard Isle,

812
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:28,190
as was stated, there's
no plans for traffic

813
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,250
to be able to go on that road

814
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,070
There it would be emergency access only

815
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,470
No one from the site would
be able to use that road.

816
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,150
It would be gated and blocked,

817
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:39,540
and even the folks who would
be further to the south

818
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,520
of the project, would have no choice

819
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,230
but to go up and use Simpson Road

820
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,420
and use the exit out onto
Simpson Road to the north.

821
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,680
So I understand the concerns

822
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,530
of more traffic on Hilliard Isle,

823
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,620
but that's not what is being asked for.

824
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,750
It's not what would be presented later

825
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,647
in the subsequent approval.

826
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:01,440
Again, as was stated earlier,

827
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,790
I just want to reiterate
that this request is merely

828
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,940
on bringing this site into the city.

829
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,400
It has nothing to do
with the actual approvals

830
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,130
of what will ultimately be built there.

831
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,680
It's merely trying to
make this site subject

832
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,180
to city oversight, as
opposed to county oversight.

833
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,593
- Thank you.

834
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,410
Board, any motions
regarding this agenda item?

835
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:30,410
- Yeah, we're still talking
about annexing 500-some acres?

836
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,940
- That's the sole scope

837
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,230
of what we're dealing with right now.

838
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,530
- Okay, according to 5A...

839
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:37,763
Hmm?

840
00:33:37,763 --> 00:33:39,030
I'll make a motion-

841
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,440
- Oh sorry, could I ask a question first?

842
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,273
- Sure, go ahead.

843
00:33:41,273 --> 00:33:42,420
- Yeah, well what we could do though is,

844
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,141
if we have a motion on the floor

845
00:33:44,141 --> 00:33:44,974
and then we get a second,

846
00:33:44,974 --> 00:33:46,874
we would have discussion
prior to the vote anyway.

847
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:47,707
- Let's go to discussion.

848
00:33:47,707 --> 00:33:49,232
- But if you wanna hold off on the motion.

849
00:33:49,232 --> 00:33:50,065
- I'll hold off on the motion.

850
00:33:50,065 --> 00:33:50,898
- Okay, Alex, go ahead.

851
00:33:50,898 --> 00:33:52,740
- Yeah, so I appreciate the context,

852
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,360
both from developers and the locals.

853
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,540
Now if we restrict attention
to the actual annexation,

854
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,037
I still have a question,
I guess, for the city.

855
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:02,744
This parcel, it is a large parcel

856
00:34:02,744 --> 00:34:05,460
and my understanding is part
of it is sort of floodplain

857
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,293
and stuff.

858
00:34:06,293 --> 00:34:09,812
Are there any immediate recurring
maintenance obligations,

859
00:34:09,812 --> 00:34:13,389
financial obligations
that the annexation alone

860
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:17,402
of the property in its
current state would induce?

861
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:19,637
- That, correct me if I'm wrong,

862
00:34:19,637 --> 00:34:22,430
that's later in the development process.

863
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,780
- So the only criteria with state,

864
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,117
which is the same locally here,

865
00:34:27,117 --> 00:34:30,360
the only criteria that we look at

866
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,220
for voluntary annexation is

867
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,340
whether or not it is
contiguous or adjacent

868
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,620
to another property in the city.

869
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,053
That is from Florida statutes.

870
00:34:39,053 --> 00:34:41,850
I believe in the staff
report that's gonna be,

871
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,365
don't quote me on this,

872
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:47,310
but I think it's the Florida
statute 177, I think.

873
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,020
Well, 177,

874
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,460
then also with the city
that the only criteria,

875
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,990
again this is annexation,

876
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,240
this is not anything to put conditions

877
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,510
on how the properties get developed.

878
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:03,180
It is only whether or not
it's contiguous to the city.

879
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,650
It's pretty much,

880
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,680
the applicant is requesting permission

881
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,400
to enter the city of
Kissimmee from Osceola County.

882
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,290
Yeah, so with regards to your questions,

883
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,800
there's no fiscal types of analysis.

884
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,920
What we do, actually, for fiscal analysis

885
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,763
for the application is
compared to on the taxes

886
00:35:22,763 --> 00:35:24,840
and the property values,

887
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,150
and folks during a voluntary annexation,

888
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,850
they weigh that, as far
as what the benefits

889
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:33,360
that they may have in entering the city

890
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,640
that they don't have different services,

891
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,480
those types of things.

892
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,610
So from a a financial standpoint,

893
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,160
that's done privately as
far as weighing the benefits

894
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,520
of the services that they have now versus

895
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,510
what they would have in city.

896
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,190
But for the staff and the analysis,

897
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,310
there's not any fiscal
or any type of financial.

898
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,050
It's just whether or not it's contiguous

899
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,334
to property in the city.

900
00:35:54,334 --> 00:35:55,167
- But I guess currently,

901
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:57,510
even though it's largely undeveloped,

902
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,770
are there any properties, any parcels,

903
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,620
that are developed on the
property currently at all, or?

904
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,679
- I don't think so.

905
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:04,110
I don't know if there's any structures

906
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,433
or anything like that.

907
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:07,710
It's probably all agricultural.

908
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,410
I mean, the portion that's
in the city right now has

909
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,990
an agricultural conservation zoning

910
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,570
because the subject site
that's under view now

911
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,460
is currently within the county.

912
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,260
I believe you see here
even on the aerials,

913
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,690
that there may be some
of the property here

914
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:25,427
that may have existing
single family homes on it,

915
00:36:25,427 --> 00:36:27,990
and I think on here further east

916
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,050
there might be another structure,

917
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,942
but that's pretty much it.

918
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:33,185
But for us,

919
00:36:33,185 --> 00:36:35,760
there's not any type of
laying on the financial.

920
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,493
It is only when or not this
property is contiguous.

921
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,670
- But I guess because it's
a voluntary annexation,

922
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,990
the developer currently owns

923
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,580
all of these parcels under consideration.

924
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,020
- Yes.

925
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,853
- Thank you.

926
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:50,858
- Okay. Board, anything else?

927
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,180
- No? Me, my turn?

928
00:36:55,053 --> 00:36:55,961
- If you like.

929
00:36:55,961 --> 00:36:58,140
- I make a motion to approve 5A,

930
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,853
to annex 553,

931
00:37:02,285 --> 00:37:05,370
556 acres 0.33 tenths.

932
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,919
I make a motion to approve.

933
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:09,180
- Okay, we have a motion
on the floor from Robert.

934
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,388
Do we have a second?

935
00:37:10,388 --> 00:37:11,665
- I'll second.

936
00:37:11,665 --> 00:37:12,564
Second.

937
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:13,860
- Second from Alex.

938
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,213
Any further discussion?

939
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,330
If not, all in favor, please say, "Aye."

940
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,380
Aye.
- Aye.

941
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,600
- Opposed, please say, "No."

942
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,541
Okay, hearing none, motion carries.

943
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:28,541
5B.

944
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:30,570
- Thank you again, Christian
Arias, Development services.

945
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,403
Good evening.

946
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,380
This is the land use application

947
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,293
that's attached to the
annexation previously discussed.

948
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,153
Again, the applicant has filed

949
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:41,880
a land use plan amendment application

950
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,553
as part of the Hilliard Isles project.

951
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,500
Also, if I may take this time
to proceed with the record.

952
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,660
Same for this as the previous application,

953
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,150
there was a submitted error

954
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,730
to the public notice regarding
the legal description

955
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,680
which has been corrected and is included

956
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,453
in your staff report.

957
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:06,930
Again, we're tasked here in front of us.

958
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,700
We previously had the annexation.

959
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,810
This is just a footprint

960
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:12,060
which is required by
state statutes as well.

961
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,490
This is actually the footprint
which is the first layer,

962
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:17,280
which is the land use designation,

963
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,020
which are actually governed

964
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,361
and seen by our comprehensive plan.

965
00:38:22,361 --> 00:38:23,910
We have in the city of comprehensive plan

966
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,430
with both objectives and policies.

967
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,583
So this is part of what's
being proposed at this point.

968
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,783
For the record,

969
00:38:32,783 --> 00:38:33,660
the subject property is located

970
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,470
within east of Simpson Road
and west of the East Lake Toho.

971
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,900
A portion of the subject
property was annexed

972
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,685
into the city of Kissimmee in 2002,

973
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:45,510
and the other portion was annexed in 2006,

974
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,350
the northern portion

975
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:49,290
or northern parts were previously annexed.

976
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:52,620
Both of these properties
have a land use designation

977
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,560
currently with single family,
low density residential

978
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,413
and multi-family medium
density residential.

979
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,350
Subject property, once annexed,

980
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:05,493
will consist of a total
area of 883 acres of land.

981
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,400
And the proposal is to designate

982
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,770
the following land use designation

983
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:12,930
for the future development
of the subject site,

984
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,690
which will consist of single family,

985
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,430
low density residential,

986
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,190
multi-family, medium density residential,

987
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,830
commercial general,
and conservation areas.

988
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,210
We can see in this map, actually,

989
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:27,870
it's laid out how this
will work and function.

990
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:28,855
As you can see,

991
00:39:28,855 --> 00:39:33,180
the applicant's designating
over 178 acres of land

992
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,120
for conservation to work for
the open space requirements

993
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,230
and to have any mitigation

994
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,923
within the East Lake Toho waterway.

995
00:39:41,483 --> 00:39:43,770
And the commercial is mostly concentrated,

996
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,170
it's gonna be concentrated
towards Simpson Road.

997
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,260
The Development Review
Committee has reviewed

998
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,040
and recommended approval
on March 21st, 2023,

999
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,290
for this application

1000
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:58,470
and the proposed land use
designation meets all the goals,

1001
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:01,650
policies and objectives of
the city comprehensive plan.

1002
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,410
Therefore staff is recommending approval

1003
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,620
on this application,

1004
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,857
and this concludes my report

1005
00:40:05,857 --> 00:40:07,780
and I'll be happy to answer any questions.

1006
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,880
- Board, any questions for the city staff?

1007
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,820
If not, would the applicant like

1008
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,920
to add anything additional regarding this?

1009
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,153
- Thank you again.

1010
00:40:17,153 --> 00:40:18,630
Eric Ross, Inspired
Placemaking Collective,

1011
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:22,380
4767 New Broad Street,
Orlando, Florida 32814.

1012
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,020
Just wanna say that we agree
with the staff recommendation.

1013
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,820
We're here to answer any questions.

1014
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:30,060
We'd appreciate the ability
to respond to any comments.

1015
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,497
Thank you.

1016
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:33,500
- Okay, board any questions
for the applicant?

1017
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,870
If not, we'll take any public
comments regarding this.

1018
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:39,090
Any comments from the public?

1019
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,710
Any public comments?

1020
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,750
No? Okay.

1021
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,903
Do we have any motions
regarding this 5B agenda item?

1022
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,630
- I'll make a motion to approve it.

1023
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,040
- Motion to approve from Robert.

1024
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,873
- Yeah.

1025
00:40:50,873 --> 00:40:52,156
- Do we have a second?

1026
00:40:52,156 --> 00:40:52,989
- I second.

1027
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:54,120
- We have a second from Diana.

1028
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,800
Any discussion?

1029
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,060
Discussion? No?

1030
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,732
All in favor, please say, "Aye."

1031
00:40:58,732 --> 00:40:59,565
- Aye.
- Aye.

1032
00:40:59,565 --> 00:41:00,670
Opposed, please say, "No."

1033
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,353
Hearing none, motion carries.

1034
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,520
Thank you, and lemme
go back with the record

1035
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,880
and make sure that we
understand for the record,

1036
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,070
Melissa, did you vote or not vote?

1037
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,361
- I did not.

1038
00:41:15,361 --> 00:41:16,194
I abstained from 5B.

1039
00:41:16,194 --> 00:41:17,027
- Okay, again,

1040
00:41:17,027 --> 00:41:20,430
I will say that I should
have stated upfront that,

1041
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,140
do we have any conflicts of interest here?

1042
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,120
But to be clear, you did not vote.

1043
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,080
You abstained.

1044
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,950
Okay.

1045
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,770
So we have the vote as the
remainder of the board.

1046
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,303
Okay, and it was approved.

1047
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,283
Okay, thank you.

1048
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,720
Six, public hearings, we don't
have anything under that.

1049
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,380
Discussion. Any discussion?

1050
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,213
Board members.

1051
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,250
Dear chairman and board members,

1052
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,020
anybody have anything?

1053
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,820
Do we have a next meeting scheduled?

1054
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,377
- I do not, (chuckles)

1055
00:41:49,377 --> 00:41:52,110
but again, just look out for your emails.

1056
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,170
Again, we try to provide you these agendas

1057
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,301
by Friday so we know, we understand

1058
00:41:57,301 --> 00:41:58,604
that you're busy, just like ourselves,

1059
00:41:58,604 --> 00:41:59,970
so that way at least you have the weekend

1060
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,620
to review that.

1061
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,330
Anytime, even before these meetings,

1062
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,100
that you have any questions or concerns,

1063
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,720
you can provide those to us.

1064
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,487
Please don't press "Reply to all,"

1065
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:11,160
but you can also reach out
to us before the meetings

1066
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,570
if you have any general comments,

1067
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,610
clarification that you may have

1068
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,773
regarding any agenda items, too, as well.

1069
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:19,740
And we'll be sure to,

1070
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,470
once we look at the different
projects that we have,

1071
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,420
we will send out a cancellation

1072
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,060
if there aren't any agenda
items for the next meeting.

1073
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:30,349
If not, we will make sure
that we get those out to you

1074
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:31,942
in a timely manner.

1075
00:42:31,942 --> 00:42:32,877
- Okay.

1076
00:42:32,877 --> 00:42:34,050
Anything else? Anyone else?

1077
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:34,883
Motion to adjourn?

1078
00:42:34,883 --> 00:42:36,017
- I'll make a motion.

1079
00:42:36,017 --> 00:42:37,770
- Motion to adjourn, Melissa,

1080
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,210
and Robert, second.

1081
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,043
Any discussion on that?

1082
00:42:40,043 --> 00:42:41,970
If not, all in favor, please say, "Aye."

1083
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:42,870
- Aye.
- Aye.

1084
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:46,179
Meeting adjourned at 6:49. Thank you.

1085
00:42:46,179 --> 00:42:49,512
(participants chatting)

1086
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:02,177
(participants chatting continues)

1087
00:43:07,957 --> 00:43:12,124
(participants chatting continues)

1088
00:43:19,394 --> 00:43:23,561
(participants chatting continues)
