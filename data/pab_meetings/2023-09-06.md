## Agenda Item 4A: Old Business - Car Wash Development at 51-53 West Pine Street

### Project Overview
- **Location:** 51-53 West Pine Street (northwest corner of Main Street and Vine Street)
- **Applicant:** Matt Britton, 3708 West Lawn Avenue, Tampa, Florida
- **Project Type:** Conditional use with site-specific redevelopment plan
- **Proposal:** Redevelopment of former 7-11 site into a 5,300 square foot car wash facility

### Background
- Current property has approximately 3,000 square foot building (former 7-11) and tenant space at 53 West Vine
- Property is part of the Scottie's modification PUD approved in 1999
- Site was previously affected by Main Street widening improvements in 2018, which added a turn lane and required a "Cure Plan" for the affected 7-11 property
- The PUD zoning allows for a car wash via conditional use approval

### Project Details
- **Facility Features:**
  - Three-lane queuing system on south side adjacent to Vine Street
  - Tunnel oriented towards Main Street
  - Vacuum stations for interior cleaning
  - Total facility: 5,300 square feet

### City's Form-Based Code Initiative
Staff noted this project is part of the city's initiative to redevelop the Vine Street corridor. In 2020, the city incorporated form-based standards to:
- Transform Vine Street from auto-oriented to more pedestrian-friendly
- Encourage diverse uses
- Further redevelop both Vine Street corridor and downtown area

The applicant worked with city staff to incorporate design standards that align with these goals, even though the existing PUD zoning predated the form-based code.

### Staff Recommendations
- Staff recommended approval with conditions
- Conditions 1 and 2 were modified from the original proposal
- Conditions 3 through 8 remained unchanged
- All modifications were provided to the board

### Board Action
- **Motion to approve:** Melissa (with modified conditions 1 and 2)
- **Second:** Robert
- **Vote:** Approved unanimously with no discussion or public comment

## Agenda Item 5A: New Business - Taylor Isles Annexation (556 acres)

### Conflict of Interest Declaration
- One board member (Melissa) declared a conflict of interest for items 5A and 5B and abstained from voting on both items

### Project Overview
- **Applicant:** Eric Raasch, Inspired Placemaking, 4767 New Broad Street, Orlando, FL 32814
- **Project Name:** Taylor Isles (previously referred to as Hilliard Isles in some public comments)
- **Total Project Size:** 883 acres
- **Annexation Request:** 556 acres from unincorporated Osceola County into City of Kissimmee
- **Location:** East of Simpson Road, west of East Lake Toho
- **Northern Portion:** 327 acres already annexed in 2002 and 2006

### Legal Notice Correction
Staff noted there was an error in the public notice regarding the legal description, which was corrected and presented to the board.

### Property Context
- The northern portion (327 acres) was previously annexed into the city in 2002 and 2006
- The southern portion (556 acres) is currently in unincorporated Osceola County
- Property is contiguous/adjacent to existing city limits, meeting requirements for voluntary annexation
- Includes a small sliver of Borinquen Drive right-of-way (part of the original plat)

### Conceptual Development Vision
The applicant presented a conceptual plan (noting this was for information only, as the board was only considering annexation):

**Proposed Uses:**
- 3,000 dwelling units (mix of single-family and multi-family)
- 190,000 square feet of non-residential (mixed-use center)
- Single-family homes located primarily on east side
- Mixed-use center on Simpson Road frontage
- Conservation areas along East Lake Toho shoreline (~178 acres)

**Key Design Features:**
- Interconnected trail system throughout community
- Multiple small parks centrally located
- Tree preservation (old growth oak trees)
- Emergency-only access to existing residential neighborhoods to the west (gated, sodded, stabilized)
- Primary access off Simpson Road to the north

**Development Timeline:**
- Phased development over 8-10 years
- Expected to proceed from west (Simpson Road) to east
- Each phase must have complete infrastructure before occupancy
- Earliest construction start: mid-2024
- 18-month lag before first residents move in

### Comparison to County Development Rights
Under current Osceola County zoning (Low Density Residential at 8 units/acre):
- Could potentially develop 5,500 dwelling units
- Annexing to Kissimmee at 3,000 units represents a **decrease of 2,493 units**
- Adds 190,000 sq ft of non-residential uses

### Staff Analysis
- Development Review Committee reviewed and recommended approval on March 21, 2023
- Meets requirements for voluntary annexation (contiguous to city limits per Florida Statute 177)
- Staff recommended approval

### Public Comments

**1. Lisa Gonzalez (2372 Aurora Court)**
- Received notice only one day before meeting (placed in mailbox 9/5)
- Questions about:
  - Emergency egress (answered: emergency-only access, not for public use)
  - Whether her property would become part of city (answered: no, only highlighted areas)
  - City water services (answered: city doesn't provide water; Toho Water Authority does)
- Concern about being county property surrounded by city property

**2. Tony Samota (1730 Lee Janzen Drive, Kissimmee Bay)**
- Lives south of the project
- Major concern: **Flooding and stormwater runoff**
- Hurricane Ian caused flooding in Kissimmee Bay neighborhood for days
- Oxbow Pond located just south of site
- Wanted on record that southern residents are concerned development will add to existing flooding problems

**3. Thomas Vossick (2620 Cahokia Court)**
- Lives on Hilliard Isle Road (western side)
- **Primary concerns:**
  - Hilliard Isle is a narrow, barely two-lane country road
  - It's the only access to Simpson Road for western neighborhoods
  - Already dangerously congested with no traffic signal at Simpson Road
  - City previously approved 300-unit multi-family development on Hilliard Isle in 2023 (not yet started)
  - Believes thousands of vehicles from new development will use Hilliard Isle despite developer claims
  - Construction vehicles will need to use Hilliard Isle as it's the only road into the area
  - **Infrastructure concerns:**
    - City council promised Simpson Road improvements would be complete by August 2024
    - Work hasn't even begun in that area
    - Massive funding shortages causing delays
    - State law considers infrastructure "complete" once funding is approved, even before construction begins
  - Urged board to encourage council to delay development until infrastructure is actually in place

### Developer Response (Cecelia Dorn, 17 South Orlando Avenue, Kissimmee)

**Annexation Impact:**
- Annexation will have **no impact** on surrounding properties unless those owners voluntarily request annexation or the city files involuntary annexation

**Infrastructure Timeline:**
- Soonest construction could begin: mid-year 2024
- Multiple approvals still needed before construction
- Additional 18 months before anyone lives in development
- Simpson Road improvements expected to be complete by then
- All infrastructure improvements required before phase completion and occupancy

**Hilliard Isle Access:**
- **No plans for traffic** on Hilliard Isle Road
- Emergency access only (gated and blocked)
- Residents in southern portions will have no choice but to use Simpson Road exit to the north
- This request is only about bringing site into city jurisdiction, not about actual development approvals

### Board Discussion

**Alex's Questions:**
- Asked about immediate recurring maintenance or financial obligations from annexation
- Staff clarified: Only criterion for voluntary annexation is whether property is contiguous/adjacent to city limits (Florida Statute 177)
- No fiscal analysis required for annexation itself
- Developer currently owns all parcels under consideration
- Property is largely undeveloped (agricultural), with possibly a few existing single-family homes

**Robert's Questions:**
- Confirmed development timeline: 8-10 years
- Confirmed 3,000 dwelling units total
- Asked about phasing (not yet finalized)

### Legal Scope Clarification
The Chair and staff repeatedly emphasized that the board's consideration was **limited to annexation only**:
- NOT considering project details, roads, lights, design, etc.
- ONLY deciding if property should be part of City of Kissimmee vs. remaining in Osceola County
- This is a voluntary annexation request

### Board Action
- **Motion to approve:** Robert (to annex 556.33 acres)
- **Second:** Alex
- **Abstention:** Melissa (conflict of interest)
- **Vote:** Approved unanimously (among voting members) with no further discussion

  - Multiple other city approvals before construction can begin
  - Earliest construction start: mid-2024
  - 18+ months before first residents
