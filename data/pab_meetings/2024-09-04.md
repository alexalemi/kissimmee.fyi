## Agenda Item 5A: Public Hearing - Conditional Use Application

### Application Details
**Applicant:** Dr. Francisca Montero
**Property Address:** 715 East Vine Street, Suite C (in Rainbow Plaza)
**Request:** Conditional use with site plan waiver to establish an educational service establishment - specifically an expanded duties dental assistant training program

### Background
- Dr. Montero has been waiting approximately 3 years for this approval
- She holds licenses from the Board of Education and Florida Department of Health to teach expanded duties dental assisting
- She has already spent approximately $200,000 on the process
- The plaza (Rainbow Plaza) currently has 101 parking spaces

### Site Visits
- Board member Alex visited the site on the afternoon of the meeting and noted that more than half the parking spaces were available

### Key Details of the Proposed Use
- **Not a full dental school** - specifically an expanded duties dental assistant training program
- Program will operate within an existing dental office
- Maximum of 4 students at any given time
- Students work in pairs
- Classes for dental assistant certification

### Staff Recommendation
City staff recommended **approval with conditions**:

1. **Location restriction:** Approval limited to 715 East Vine Street, Suite C only
2. **No expansion without approval:** The use cannot be transferred or expanded to other suites without a separate conditional use application
3. **Accessory use:** The dental school must remain accessory/secondary to the existing dental practice
4. **Limited to dental assisting:** Does not include any other public or private school uses - solely limited to dental assistant program
5. **Student cap:** Maximum of 4 students at any given time
6. **Non-overlapping hours:** Hours of operation for the dental school cannot overlap with the existing dental practice
7. **Permit requirements:** Any interior alterations require a state certified contractor and proper permits
8. **Business license:** Must be issued within one year of approval

### Parking Analysis
The parking requirements were a major point of discussion:

- **Dental practice requirement:** 11 parking spaces (2,050 sq ft ÷ 200 sq ft per space = 10.25, rounded up to 11)
- **Vocational school requirement:** 3 parking spaces (1 space per 3.5 students + 2 spaces per 3 employees)
- **Total:** 14 spaces required if both operated simultaneously
- **Solution:** Non-overlapping hours of operation to avoid exceeding parking capacity

The plaza is currently at maximum parking capacity based on all existing retail and professional uses. Staff conducted a parking analysis showing the plaza requires all 101 spaces for current approved uses.

### Clarifications During Discussion

**Terminology:**
- Initial presentation referred to it as a "dental school"
- Applicant clarified it is specifically an "expanded duties dental assistant school"
- Board member Alex questioned whether this distinction needed to be reflected in conditions
- City Attorney determined the existing language was acceptable

**Applicant's Concerns:**
- Dr. Montero expressed that she could accommodate 12 students (working in pairs) in her space
- She has 14 parking spaces allocated by her landlord
- She noted 60+ parking spaces are typically available in the evenings when she would operate
- She has been paying rent on another unit (Unit 7/G) that she had hoped to use
- She expressed frustration with the limitations but agreed to start with what was approved

**Future Expansion:**
- Any expansion would require a new conditional use application
- Dr. Montero mentioned plans for future expansion but those are not part of this approval

### Board Discussion and Vote

**Questions raised:**
- Alex questioned the restrictiveness of the student cap
- Board members sought clarification on parking allocation methodology
- Discussion of whether the same tenant could share parking spaces between two uses at different times
- Aaron Sabino raised concerns about approving something when the applicant already has expansion plans that exceed the approval

**City Staff Response:**
- Parking requirements are based on use type, not individual business success
- The plaza is at maximum parking capacity
- Different uses have different parking ratios (retail: 1 per 300 sq ft, professional office: 1 per 200 sq ft, restaurant: 1 per 80 sq ft)
- Staff must plan for worst-case scenario where all units could be highest-intensity uses
- Parking spaces are allocated to the entire plaza, not individual tenants
- City doesn't control business hours or landlord-tenant agreements
- For buildings under 25,000 sq ft, each tenant requires individual parking analysis

**Motion and Vote:**
- **Motion:** Alex moved to approve the conditional use with the city's recommended restrictions
- **Second:** Diana
- **Vote:** Unanimous approval (Aye votes from all present members, no opposition)
- **Result:** APPROVED

## Extended Discussion: Parking Requirements and Comprehensive Plan

Following the vote, the board engaged in a lengthy discussion about parking requirements in the city, particularly as they relate to the comprehensive plan goals.

### Issues Raised by Board Member Alex

**Key Arguments:**
1. Current parking requirements in the T5-U transit zone and Multimodal Transit District (MMTD) are overly restrictive
2. Parking lots are rarely full - observed less than half occupancy at the site
3. Parking requirements create barriers to infill development and mixed-use development
4. Requirements conflict with comprehensive plan policies promoting:
   - Innovative land use strategies (Policy 1.1.5)
   - Density and intensity near transit in MMTD (Policy 1.1.5.8)
   - Mixed-use transit-oriented development (Policy 1161)
   - Pedestrian-oriented site design (Policy 1162)
   - Pedestrian-oriented building design (Policy 1163)

**Specific Observations:**
- Current requirements feel oppressive in the multimodal transit district
- Many cities nationwide have loosened or eliminated parking minimums with positive results
- Downtown Broadway core is exempt from parking requirements, but exemption doesn't extend to full downtown CRA or Vine Street CRA
- This case illustrates how parking requirements become a burden for businesses trying to improve the city

**Proposed Solutions Discussed:**
1. **Most aggressive:** Eliminate parking requirements entirely city-wide
2. **Moderate:** Extend existing downtown exemption to entire MMTD or Vine Street CRA
3. **Targeted:** Create exemption for specific areas within Vine Street CRA
4. **Flexible:** Change parking "requirements" to "recommendations" (non-binding)
5. **Appeals-based:** Expand existing waiver process from 50% maximum to 100%, potentially through PAB approval

### Response from City Attorney

**Board Authority Clarification:**
- PAB **cannot** change the land development code
- PAB **can** propose amendments to the comprehensive plan
- PAB **cannot** make final decisions on comprehensive plan amendments - only recommendations to City Commission
- Board is confined to current code and comprehensive plan when reviewing applications
- Board's primary role is evaluating whether applications are consistent with existing plans and codes

**Legal Considerations:**
- Parking requirements are tied to capacity and safety concerns
- Eliminating all requirements would mean no developer would provide parking (cost and space considerations)
- Requirements are based on generic use types, not specific business success
- Matrix system (200 sq ft, 300 sq ft ratios) provides consistency and fairness

### Response from Board Member Diana (Main Street Director)

**Practical Perspective:**
- Has personally dealt with parking issues for downtown businesses
- Has worked on shared parking agreements (e.g., church parking for businesses)
- Has dealt with variance requests to prove businesses don't need required parking
- Supports review of parking requirements

**Process Concerns:**
- The board spent 20+ minutes discussing something outside their authority
- This should be addressed in training sessions, not during application hearings
- Need to be considerate of applicants and audience waiting for decisions
- Board should focus on their actual role: evaluating applications against existing code
- Suggested tabling broader policy discussions for public training sessions

### Response from City Staff (Douglas Ethridge, Assistant Director)

**Important Announcement:**
- Parking requirements are **already under review** by city staff
- Commission has already directed staff to study this issue
- Consultants are already lined up
- This is on the docket but will take years to complete due to complexity

**Complexity Factors:**
- Not just a planning department issue
- Involves fire access and safety
- Involves ADA compliance and state accessibility requirements
- Multiple departments and agencies involved
- Must consider consistency and fairness across all use types
- Need to look at every aspect, not just one-size-fits-all solution

**Priority Management:**
- City has many directives from Commission
- Matter of prioritizing which projects to tackle first
- Staff capacity is a limiting factor

### Additional Board and Staff Comments

**Chairman's Observations:**
- Questioned whether parking spaces for one use (dental practice during day) could be "fungible" for same tenant's other use (school at night)
- Noted the same tenant wouldn't be in conflict with themselves between different uses
- Expressed general support for reviewing parking requirements

**Board Member Aaron Sabino:**
- Emphasized focusing on what the applicant brings to downtown
- Supports professional training and job creation
- Cautioned against board "getting into the weeds" and trying to be engineers
- Board should focus on advisory role regarding comprehensive plan
- Appreciates what the applicant offers for short-term use while she grows

**City Staff Additional Clarification:**
- Parking spaces are for entire plaza, not allocated to specific persons
- Must ensure fairness for all tenants
- Can conduct shared parking analysis and parking demand studies
- Buildings over 25,000 sq ft use combined parking requirements
- Buildings under 25,000 sq ft require individual tenant parking analysis
- Must plan for potential highest-intensity use (e.g., restaurants at 1 per 80 sq ft)
- City doesn't control business hours - businesses could operate 24 hours
- City doesn't control what landlords allow tenants

### Applicant's Final Comments

Dr. Montero added:
- Has 14 spaces allocated by landlord
- Observes 60+ empty spaces every evening when she would operate
- Pharmacy tenant delivers medications (minimal parking demand)
- Carpet store has minimal foot traffic
- With current limitations, has "no room to roll" (no flexibility for growth)
- Also mentioned homeless people frequenting the building at night

### Board Response and Closure

**Chairman's Final Remarks:**
- Acknowledged parking study is already in progress
- Encouraged applicant to discuss future expansion through proper city application process
- Confirmed the board approved what was before them
- Supported reviewing parking requirements to determine what makes sense
- Noted the same tenant with multiple uses shouldn't have conflicting requirements
- If tenant has 14 allocated spaces, should be able to use them across different time periods

## Summary Analysis

This meeting exemplified the tension between practical development needs and existing regulatory frameworks. While the board approved the application as required by code, the extensive discussion revealed concerns that current parking requirements may be impeding the city's stated comprehensive plan goals for transit-oriented, pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use development in the Vine Street corridor.

The applicant's case - a small vocational training program requiring conditional use approval and facing student caps due to parking calculations - served as a catalyst for broader discussion about whether Kissimmee's parking policies align with its vision for downtown development. The revelation that parking requirements are already under comprehensive review by city staff and consultants suggests these concerns are recognized at the administrative level as well.

Board member Diana's intervention highlighted an important procedural question: when should policy discussions occur versus application reviews? This tension between the board's dual roles - as application reviewers and comprehensive plan advisors - will likely need clearer definition going forward, particularly as training sessions are implemented.

The meeting concluded on a positive note with approval for Dr. Montero to begin her dental assistant training program, albeit with limitations she finds restrictive. Her ability to expand in the future will require navigating the same conditional use process again, with parking requirements continuing to be a central consideration in any such application.
