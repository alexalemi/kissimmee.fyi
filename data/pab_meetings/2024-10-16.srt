1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,843
- Okay, calling the meeting
to order at 6:02 PM.

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,423
Thank you all for being here.

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,540
Can I ask everyone to stand
for a moment of silence

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,340
and the pledge of allegiance please?

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,400
- I pledge allegiance to the flag

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,410
of the United States of America

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,900
and to the republic for which it stands,

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,790
one nation under God,

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,970
indivisible with liberty
and justice for all.

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,890
- Thank you, please be seated.

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,860
I'm gonna ask everybody to,
and I'll make sure I do also,

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,860
silence your electronic devices
please, board members too.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,280
Okay, first up, we have
approval of the July 17th, 2020

14
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:03,420
PAB meeting minutes.

15
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,373
Do we have any motions regarding that?

16
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,083
- Can I interject really
quickly too as well before,

17
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,410
just to remind the board,
the Planning Advisory Board,

18
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,740
to maintain consistency with
our other advisory boards

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,010
and City Commission, if
there are any motions

20
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,180
to make modifications to the PAB

21
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,343
that it should not be for verbatim.

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,090
The city clerk and city policies

23
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,630
is that any motions that you may entertain

24
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,960
should not include verbatim
because the general practice

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,430
is the minutes are not verbatim.

26
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,380
So I just wanted to keep that in mind

27
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,570
as you go through the
minutes and the motion.

28
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,630
We got that clarification
from our city clerk's office

29
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,310
that we have to maintain consistency

30
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,920
with our other advisory
boards and City Commission

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,570
being it's minutes should not be verbatim.

32
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,403
- Okay.

33
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:59,850
- And you'll see the slight changes

34
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,280
because this is why we have
three minutes brought back,

35
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,710
that we brought it back to you

36
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,740
consistent with city
policies regarding minutes.

37
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,850
- So we're approving, like,

38
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,730
are there inaccuracies
or things like that?

39
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,800
Like, wrong dates and stuff.

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,030
- There were motions
that were made before-

41
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,770
- Specifically what was said-

42
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,880
- And that's why we're bringing back

43
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,713
three sets minutes to you.

44
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:23,580
- Oh, okay, okay, so Robert, you?

45
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,467
- To make a motion.

46
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:26,190
- Motion to approve?
- Yes.

47
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,680
- Robert Kaplan, do we have a second?

48
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,513
- Second.

49
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:33,480
- Second from Alex, any discussion?

50
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,300
If not, all in favor, please say aye.

51
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,380
- Aye.
- Aye.

52
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,990
- And I'm gonna, after
discussion with Kalanit,

53
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,880
I'm just gonna abstain
because I wasn't here,

54
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,000
because I'm saying,
yeah, I agree with this,

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,310
so I wasn't here so I'm
abstaining from that.

56
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,998
And then August 7th PAB minutes.

57
00:02:51,998 --> 00:02:54,570
Do we have a motion regarding
that meeting minutes?

58
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,740
- Motion to approve.

59
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,623
- Robert, motion to approve,
do we have a second?

60
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,920
- Second.
- Second from Alex.

61
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,590
And do we have any
discussion changes, anything?

62
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,050
If not, all in favor, please say aye.

63
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:07,883
- Aye.
- Aye.

64
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,790
- And abstain 'cause I wasn't
here, and for September 4th.

65
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,003
Do we have a motion to
approve or any motion?

66
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,790
- Make a motion to approve.

67
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,400
- Robert, motion to approve,
do we have a second?

68
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,070
- I'll second.
- We have a second from Alex.

69
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,110
Any discussion or changes?

70
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,060
All in favor, please say aye.

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,893

- I was here for that
one, okay, all business.

73
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,413
Nothing there, new
business, 5A public hearing.

74
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,400
- Might hope if I turn
this on, there we go.

75
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,470
Board members, before you today

76
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,050
is a request for an approval
of a conditional use

77
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,250
with site plan waiver

78
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,360
to establish a driving
school at 400 Church Street

79
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,450
on approximately 0.34 acres of land

80
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,283
with a mixed use T5-M zoning designation.

81
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,180
The structure was built in 1955

82
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,720
and was used at the church
for multiple tenants,

83
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,860
including Calvary Assembly of God

84
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,750
and St. Luke's Missionary Church.

85
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,330
In 1980, a permit was submitted

86
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,080
for the concrete pavement that now exists

87
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,380
and the parcel zoning was
B4 Main Street commercial

88
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,930
before it was rezoned

89
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,500
for the T5-M mixed use
center transect zoning,

90
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,110
which is its current zoning now.

91
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,630
It also has a future land use of MUD,

92
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,613
which is mixed use downtown.

93
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,693
Currently there are multiple
businesses tied to this parcel.

94
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,560
Currently Your Holistic Center, LLC,

95
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,490
which is a retail professional
service establishment

96
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,770
and essential services for u-inc,

97
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,190
which is another professional
service establishment,

98
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,820
have current 2025 business license.

99
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,360
In 2024, there were also business license

100
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,993
for a dental office and
a chiropractic office.

101
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,760
This proposed conditional use

102
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,200
is intended to use the property

103
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,050
as an educational service establishment,

104
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,970
specifically an online driving school

105
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,160
that will include spaces for people

106
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,250
who do not have access to computers.

107
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,830
There will be two computers on site.

108
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,070
Since the building is considered
a legal non-conforming

109
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,210
and this conditional use

110
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,760
is not expanding that non-conformity,

111
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,090
the development review
committee did not see the need

112
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,403
for major improvements
to the parking area.

113
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,610
For the findings and reasons,

114
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,440
this is compliant with the intent

115
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,330
of the mixed use center T5-M

116
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:49,670
as a conditional use per section 14 5 4f

117
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,310
of the land development code.

118
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,940
It's in compliance with
section 14 5 6, table 5 1,

119
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,470
which is our use table,

120
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,730
as educational service
establishments are conditional use

121
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,930
in this zoning district.

122
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,830
It's compliant with section 14 3 29c2

123
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,423
for the site plan waiver
as there's no all interior,

124
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,283
all modifications will be
interior there's no exterior,

125
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,030
you know, for existing parking or loading

126
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,060
or the existing building
happening or occurring.

127
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,680
It's in compliance with
section 14 3 29g 1 through 13

128
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,780
for the conditional use review

129
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,280
from our land development code.

130
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,450
And it is compliant

131
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,450
with comprehensive plan future
land use element policy 1292

132
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,183
for the mixed use
downtown future land use.

133
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,050
The development review
in September 9th, 2024

134
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,120
approved this with conditions,

135
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,920
and those conditions are as followed.

136
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,280
One, approval of an educational
service establishment

137
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,180
for a driving school

138
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,200
is for 400 Church Street Unit 109 only.

139
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,390
This educational service establishment use

140
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,630
cannot be transferred or
expanded to another suite.

141
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,520
A separate conditional use application

142
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,980
and approval by the
Planning Advisory Board

143
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,020
will be required to transfer or expand

144
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,370
this educational service
establishment on this parcel.

145
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,380
A business license for the driving school

146
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,820
must be issued within one year

147
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,440
of the conditional use approval.

148
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,290
If a business license is
not issued within a year,

149
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,293
the conditional use
approval will be revoked.

150
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,230
Once the business license is issued,

151
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,930
the conditional use is
valid on this parcel.

152
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,840
If there's ever a lapse of one year

153
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,110
with no business license
with this conditional use,

154
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,273
the approval will be considered void.

155
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,820

156
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,610

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,290
for those computers and for the parking,

158
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,390
and there shall be no modifications

159
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,233
to the Toho infrastructure, and that's it.

160
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,043
- Okay, board members, any
questions for the city?

161
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,440
If not, are the applicants
here, the applicants?

162
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,300
You're welcome to step to the podium,

163
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,640
and if you'd like to say
anything or add anything,

164
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,473
you're not required

165
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:11,648
but you're welcome to if you'd like.

166
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:12,660
- No, just to say hello to everybody,

167
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,770
but know we're fine.

168
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,973
- Okay, thank you.

169
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Board, do we have any motions
regarding this agenda item?

170
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,160
- I missed what kind
of educational program?

171
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,390
- Sorry, a question, go ahead.

172
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,580
- It's an online driving school,

173
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,980
but they are offering two computers

174
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,140
for those who don't have
access to the internet

175
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,140
to go get the certification
for the driving portion.

176
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,433
- Okay.

177
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,903
- So, sorry, Aaron, do you
have something, go ahead.

178
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,000
- When I was reviewing this
particular conditional use

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,950
for this particular property,

180
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,660
knowing the vibrancy in the direction

181
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,403
the downtown city is going,

182
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,290
my concerns with bringing in
an educational institution

183
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,730
at this particular location

184
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,250
could cause some issues with the growth

185
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,380
going into that main street

186
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,260
where it's crossing from
Broadway to Main Street,

187
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,993
you have that tattoo shop
that's right behind it.

188
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,960
I feel like there are restrictions
in the state of Florida.

189
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,630
I'm not quite sure what
they are in Osceola County.

190
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:26,630
What can open and not be
open near a educational?

191
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:32,130
I do know, I believe, in
Orlando it's 500 feet,

192
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,990
but I'm not sure if it's the
same here in Osceola County.

193
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,940
But I just wanted to make sure
will that cause any issues

194
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,850
if other shops wanted to open up nearby

195
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,950
that may be the extension

196
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,160
of maybe restaurants
that have bars, right?

197
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,460
Would that be a issue
with them being there

198
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,363
as an educational institution
at this particular location?

199
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,390
- I mean, the s, oh goodness,

200
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,310
'cause I wanna get the
verbiage just perfect.

201
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,230
The educational service establishments

202
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,640
are more like vocational,

203
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,740
they're not like institutions or schools,

204
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,623
but they do give training for other,

205
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,640
for certification or something like that.

206
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,860
So usually with the limit

207
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,160
of being near an alcohol store or bar

208
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,993
or something like that,

209
00:10:23,993 --> 00:10:28,940
that's primarily for colleges,
elementary school, middle.

210
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,460
But this kind of educational establishment

211
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,420
wouldn't be considered.

212
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,460
So anybody could be able

213
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,813
to have their bar on the next parcel.

214
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,447
- Okay, I had to, I think,

215
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,573
I can't recall what Florida statute or-

216
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:54,270
- I think you're referring to.

217
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,830
- I have to look at
it, exactly what it is.

218
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,010
But I think the terms was private.

219
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,830
I think the way it reads
in the actual language,

220
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,520
it doesn't permit just for middle schools,

221
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,560
high schools, and secondary schools.

222
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,240
I think it also included

223
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,480
any type of private type of institutions.

224
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,520
This would be considered a
private business, correct?

225
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,810
- It would not.

226
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,780
The key difference is
that for your business,

227
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,040
you don't have to coordinate

228
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,290
and get certification
department education.

229
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,240
- Yeah, and they're only gonna be in with,

230
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,080
it's not a consistent daily people

231
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,570
coming as an institution for education.

232
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,850
It's just for to take testing.

233
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,320
- I'm sorry, actually,
if he's gonna speak,

234
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,270
he should please step to the microphone,

235
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,093
state your name and your
address for the record, please.

236
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,460
- Sorry, good afternoon,
I'm Ruben from MBG Traffic.

237
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,530
- State your name and address
for the record, please.

238
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:51,270
- Ruben, that's my name, yes.

239
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,810
Oh, my address, 9029,
Reflection Point Drive,

240
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,453
Windermere, Florida, 34786.

241
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,800
It's not a typical institution
where educational institution

242
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,210
where you actually go daily

243
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,450
to get some kind of
information or testing,

244
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,750
it's just is an online service

245
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,050
that when people do not
have access to online,

246
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,590
they could have the
opportunity to make a date

247
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:21,590
and go in, sorry, in
office and tailor testing

248
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,250
for those who don't have
the ability to do it online.

249
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,170
But it's usually very seldom

250
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,483
and typically everything is done online.

251
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,703
So there is no really,

252
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,450
like, constant education taking place.

253
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,220
Like, you're going to
sign up for something,

254
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,843
you have to go Monday through
Friday or anything like that.

255
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:44,843
It's just a occasional kind
of assistant to the office.

256
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,720
So we're not really gonna have

257
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,630
a lot of people coming in
or out nor on any basis.

258
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,730
And certainly is only till

259
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,140
four o'clock in the afternoon or so.

260
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,970
So that's pretty much the extent

261
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,740
of what we're gonna be doing in that.

262
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,490
- But I think the statute that
you're referring to, Aaron,

263
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,880
has to do with proximity
of certain businesses

264
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,440
to educational facilities.

265
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,240
Kalanit, can you weigh in on that?

266
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,173
Is that just public schools
that that's a concern with?

267
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,180
- I don't think that that
is applicable to this,

268
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:26,180
but yes, typically it is a school.

269
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,340
This is not actually a school.

270
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,660
This is, I mean, it's
educational services,

271
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,273
but I think it's more internet access.

272
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,023
- Okay, thank you,

273
00:13:39,023 --> 00:13:41,370
any other questions or
comments from board members?

274
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,840
- I have no further questions.

275
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,390
Thank you for the explanations.

276
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:46,863
- Okay, I'm sorry.

277
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,180
- I have nothing further, I yield back.

278
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,970
- Okay, anyone wanna make a motion

279
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,320
regarding this agenda item?

280
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,620
- Make a motion to approve
with this conditions.

281
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,090
- Okay, Robert makes a motion

282
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,280
to approve with the conditions,
do we have a second?

283
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,710
- I'll second.
- We have a second from Alex.

284
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,003
Any further discussion?

285
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,690
If not, oh, wait a minute.

286
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,440
Let me ask before I move to the vote,

287
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,990
do we have any public comments?

288
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,540
Do we have any public comments?

289
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,070
Public comments, no?

290
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,650
Also, let me say before we move to a vote,

291
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:26,043
I apologize, Kalanit, I forgot
this piece outta practice.

292
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,830
If anybody has any conflicts of interest

293
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,290
or have done any site visits

294
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,160
or had ex parte communications
regarding this agenda item,

295
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,413
please let that be known before we vote.

296
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,560
If not, we'll move to a vote.

297
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,558
All in favor, please say aye.

298
00:14:45,558 --> 00:14:46,391
- Aye.
- Aye.

299
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:48,300
- Opposed, please say no.

300
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,853
Hearing none, motion carries,
thank you, thank you.

301
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:57,510
And next on the agenda, there we go.

302
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,300
Okay, public hearings, we have anything?

303
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,010
We don't have anything.

304
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,790
Discussion, any discussion
from board members?

305
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,623
I always wondering,

306
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:07,800
what is the difference between discussion

307
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,680
and here chairman and board members.

308
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,760
Isn't that kind of redundant
or is there a specific thing

309
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,230
that's supposed to be slotted into that?

310
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,270
- Again, it's the advisory boards

311
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,250
and City Commission has the same template.

312
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,470
So they have the same sections,

313
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,880
it's the same template throughout

314
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,100
for all advisory boards
and City Commission.

315
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,378
So it'll have that section,
but it won't be applicable.

316
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:28,200
- Okay.
- We all use the same template

317
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,790
for City Commission and Advisory Board.

318
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,550
- Got it, got it, so we will
move to number eight here,

319
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,930
chairman and board members,

320
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,120
I don't have anything in
particular board members.

321
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,470
- Well, I guess I so sorry,

322
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,790
Brenda, could you clarify again?

323
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,770
You said the minutes came back

324
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,060
and we had to re-approve them, why?

325
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:50,060
What was the kind of the,
that's different, yeah.

326
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,530
- So when the motion was made,

327
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,880
we couldn't approve the minutes.

328
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,530
We had to bring them back.

329
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,420
Staff went to city clerk's office

330
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,930
for clarification about
the proposed changes.

331
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,670
And it was reiterated to us
that there is for minutes

332
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,550
do not have to be and really
should not be verbatim.

333
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:13,170
So if there are any motions
making where a statement

334
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,130
to change the wording to
where it was verbatim,

335
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,440
that is not something

336
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,140
that should be under consideration

337
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,290
to make for future
modifications to the minutes.

338
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,470
So if their motions made to change wording

339
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,130
to where it's verbatim
based on the city policy

340
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,890
and to maintain consistency
with advisory boards,

341
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,900
those motions should not be made

342
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,670
because minutes should not be verbatim.

343
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,200
That was the clarification that-

344
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,000
- And did that happen recently?

345
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,830
- Yes, I think one of 'em
was to change one word

346
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,590
from what the staff had.

347
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,880
It wasn't a verbatim,

348
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,633
but it was a motion made to
change that word to verbatim,

349
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,233
a verbatim statement.

350
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:04,230
- I mean, yes, several
times ago I made a motion

351
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,900
to modify one of the minutes
because I felt as though

352
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,970
not to change the word to be verbatim

353
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,890
but to the word that was used,

354
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,900
but to change the word because
the word in the minutes

355
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,150
didn't have the same
connotation or meaning

356
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,750
or definition as the
word that what happened.

357
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,580
I didn't think that they were accurate.

358
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,830
So I guess whether or not, you know,

359
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,660
the minute should or
shouldn't be verbatim,

360
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,190
they ought to be accurate

361
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,570
and they ought to reflect
what was actually done or said

362
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,110
or happened presumably.

363
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:39,000
- But it was a word again, if
it's overall context to it,

364
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,900
and we need to maintain that consistency

365
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,320
with all the advisory boards
and City Commission minutes.

366
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,750
If there was a wrong motion,

367
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,060
and I don't know if you
even noticed too as well

368
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,100
that we've changed it

369
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,210
to where it's not specific board members,

370
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,860
it's just discussion.

371
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,560
And that was the advice and direction

372
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,320
that our city clerk provided to us

373
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,590
where it's not, "Chairman
so-and-so said this,"

374
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,630
it was discussion ensued.

375
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,470
That is the proper way moving forward

376
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,233
to maintain consistency
with other minutes.

377
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,350
- Fair enough, I guess the other thing

378
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,170
I guess I just wanted to discuss or say,

379
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,580
so in our last meeting we had
that mill slew street vacation

380
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,663
that we discussed and we
proposed an amendment too.

381
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,723
When that went before the City Commission,

382
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,050
city staff recommended

383
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,810
kind of going with the original proposal,

384
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:46,890
in the agenda packet for the board,

385
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,530
I think there was a few sentences

386
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,705
describing the discussion that we had,

387
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:54,270
the extensive discussion I
think we had in the meeting.

388
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,930
But overall I was a little
sort of disappointed

389
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:02,400
with the presentation of our discussion

390
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,690
before the City Commission.

391
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,520
And I guess I just wanted to make aware

392
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,000
to the other board members
that sort of that happened, so.

393
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,703
- Okay, let me address that.

394
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,980
The motion and discussions for
the Planning Advisory Board

395
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,910
is reflected in the
minutes or the actions,

396
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,910
and we as staff as well as
the Planning Advisory Board

397
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,280
should not change, modify
any actions that took place.

398
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,390
The action and discussion
is reflected in the minutes.

399
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,390
So we are not to inflect
expand on any motion

400
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,150
that was made on the
Planning Advisory Board.

401
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,780
Staff's responsibility

402
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,597
is to present the staff
recommendation and to state,

403
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:55,207
"This was the Planning
Advisory Board motion

404
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:57,990
"and recommendation and that was it."

405
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,990
No board member ever outside
of the form of this meeting

406
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,470
should embellish or modify any action.

407
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,880
It's reflected in the minutes,

408
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,880
it's reflected in the staff report.

409
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,740
It should not occur anything
outside of the actions

410
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,960
with the Planning Advisory Board,

411
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,813
really, it should not, ever.

412
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,213
- I guess I'm not sure-

413
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,010
- This was the motion,

414
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,490
this was the conditions, and that was it.

415
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,750
We, even as staff,
don't have the authority

416
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,820
to embellish or say anything

417
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,943
beyond what was done in those minutes.

418
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,760
- I'm gonna take the floor

419
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,760
and just see if I understand
you clearly, Brenda.

420
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,650
Basically, when you're presenting

421
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:05,130
an action that we take here to the city,

422
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,840
you are saying factually
that this is what was done.

423
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,540
And my understanding is
always that in minutes,

424
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,630
it should state what is
done not what is said.

425
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,400
And so the actions that were taken.

426
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,280
So you're presenting here's what happened

427
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,780
without any emotions or regard to that.

428
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:29,780
And that if we as board
members and citizens

429
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,950
want to discuss any item on the agenda

430
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,110
for the City Commission meeting,

431
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:42,110
we have the right to go and
make public comment as a citizen

432
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,540
about how we feel about that.

433
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,661
We have that right to do that, correct?

434
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:48,494
- Yes.

435
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:53,910
- If we do that, should that not be,

436
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,757
that should be us as a citizen,
private citizen, not as,

437
00:21:57,757 --> 00:21:59,407
"Hey, I'm Planning Advisory Board member

438
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:01,020
"and here's my thoughts."

439
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,880
I mean, although it's a matter of record

440
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,770
that we're a member
Planning Advisory Board.

441
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,940
So it's not inaccurate to say it,

442
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,150
but we are speaking for ourselves

443
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,120
as a citizen about our opinion.

444
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,500
Am I correct on that?

445
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,130
So we could do that and state that,

446
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,140
or state whatever we wanted to state

447
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,520
under those circumstances.

448
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,353
- Yeah, so-

449
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,807
- But all that you're to present is,

450
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:31,950
"This is what was done, this
is the action was taken."

451
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,283
- And I think I understand
what everyone is saying.

452
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,100
I guess from my part I'd
like to point out that yes,

453
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,690
I spoke before the City Commission

454
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,210
and I tried to make clear that
I was speaking in my capacity

455
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,503
as a citizen at the time.

456
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:49,380
I also understand that the
city staff cannot embellish

457
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,670
or sort of say things
sort of beyond the actions

458
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,223
that this board takes.

459
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,150
I guess I'm making a comment
now because I feel like,

460
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:03,750
you know, we discussed
and passed a amendment

461
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:08,750
to the proposal that came
before this board and,

462
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,910
I mean, I guess the question is

463
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:19,910
what constitutes presentation
of that to the board, right?

464
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,460
You know, we approved amendment

465
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,990
to kind of change the boundary,

466
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,560
and I guess being in that room,

467
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,560
it didn't seem like that was
communicated to the board.

468
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,180
You know, that wasn't kind of drawn up.

469
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,563
There wasn't a map, there wasn't, yeah,

470
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,579
anything of that sort.

471
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:45,900
The city agenda had the sort
of original proposal in it.

472
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,630
- So for clarification, are you asking

473
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,010
what is the extent of PAB recommendations

474
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,860
that go before City Commission?

475
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,860
Like how detailed does the
recommendation have to be?

476
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,970
Is that your concern?

477
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,613
- Yeah, I guess going
forward, I'm wondering about,

478
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,130
in so much as we have a
role as an advisory board,

479
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:19,130
if matters come before this
board that we think either,

480
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,060
you know, basically how are we best

481
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,500
to operate in our capacity

482
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,500
and what steps can we take
as a board to try to ensure

483
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,090
that the City Commission
is making the best

484
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,470
and most informed choices

485
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,850
and the ones that we think aligns

486
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,310
with the city comprehensive plan.

487
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,920
And I guess just going forward,

488
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,920
if we wanted to communicate
our concerns to the board,

489
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,950
what's the sort of
appropriate way to do that?

490
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,900
Is it most appropriate to make comments

491
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,390
as independent citizens before the board?

492
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,280
Or are there actions that
this board could take

493
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,470
to sort of better prepare things

494
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,023
to present to the commission?

495
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,150
- I just wanna clarify

496
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,360
because we're bringing this
up in a public meeting,

497
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,970
the Planning Advisory Board recommendation

498
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,580
and the condition about changing it

499
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,480
was reflected in the staff report

500
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,680
and was presented to the City Commission

501
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,463
and there was a map that
was displayed during that.

502
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:29,998
It was done.

503
00:25:29,998 --> 00:25:31,215
- Was the map the original proposal

504
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:35,619
or was it the boundaries that
we amended in the PAB meeting?

505
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,900
- It was the original proposal.

506
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,150
- Yes.

507
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,180
- We were not to draw a separate map

508
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:47,160
reflecting the Planning
Advisory Board recommendation.

509
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,960
It was included in the action.

510
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,850
It was included in the staff report,

511
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,510
the recommendation and the
motion about the missing segment.

512
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,060
It was verbally stated

513
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,340
and it was also included
in that staff report.

514
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,850
So I'm a bit confused at this point.

515
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,260
- I guess, I mean, I am too.

516
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,810
So I'm wondering, in the
future, hypothetically,

517
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,550
if another action comes before this board

518
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:12,270
and we feel like there's a
mistake in the original proposal,

519
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,680
I mean, even something minor,

520
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,300
like a mistake in the original map,

521
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,150
and let's say even, I mean,

522
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,873
and we want to amend it
to address that mistake,

523
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:27,390
how then do we effectively
communicate that

524
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,650
to the commission?

525
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:33,650
Is there any steps we could
take to, I don't know,

526
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,560
communicate that to the commission?

527
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,430
- Let me ask you a question

528
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,230
to see if I understand
what you're saying, Alex.

529
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,500
Are you saying that because,
I mean, during the meeting,

530
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,720
whatever the discussion is-
- Yes,

531
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,660
- That's the time where we
present our opinions, our ideas,

532
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,880
and correct me if I'm
wrong on this procedurally,

533
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,110
legally, or anything,

534
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,540
and we are asking questions,

535
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,780
we're presenting our opinions,
all of that sort of thing,

536
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,910
and then we come to an agreement,

537
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,330
majority rules following
the voting process.

538
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,450
Are you saying that once that's done

539
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,080
and, you know, whether the
vote goes our way or whatever,

540
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,950
once that's done

541
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,050
and they go to present it
at the City Commission,

542
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,520
are you saying if we are at the meeting

543
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,490
and we think that they
are presenting something

544
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,820
that is inaccurate or not factual?

545
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,200
Is that what you're saying?

546
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,850
- No, I guess I'm just worried.

547
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,833
I'm wondering, going forward,

548
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,010
for the most part, historically this board

549
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,640
tends to approve the
motions that come before us.

550
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,550
I think in part because we
don't find issues with them,

551
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,930
we think that the proposals

552
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,030
are in keeping with
the comprehensive plan.

553
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,000
But if something does
come before the board

554
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,070
that we think doesn't,

555
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,680
if we wanna modify
conditions or something,

556
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,110
I mean, that happens
somewhat frequently, right?

557
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,150
We either approve things
with or without conditions

558
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,060
at the recommendations
of the City Commission

559
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,260
or the city staff.

560
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,290
I guess I'm wondering, if we, as a board,

561
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:05,253
make any sort of recommendations
or changes or amendments,

562
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:10,800
what, I don't know, how does that,

563
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,780
or do we have any influence on,

564
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,550
how can we best act to then ensure

565
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:20,223
that the City Commission has access to,

566
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,900
I mean, hopefully the benefits
of our own process, right,

567
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,803
as this board,

568
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,940
and I guess just in this particular case,

569
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,940
it felt like we looked at the
proposal, we had discussion,

570
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,510
there were people from the public,

571
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,500
we kind of talked everything out.

572
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,350
I understand that's all
matter of public record.

573
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,710
But then kind of when it went
before the City Commission,

574
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,220
the city staff recommendation

575
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,930
was to go with the original proposal

576
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,529
and the presentation amounted to,

577
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:55,710
you know, a statement that
the PAB passed an amendment.

578
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,553
- Okay, I think I understand
now where you're coming from.

579
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:04,050
The PAB made a different separate
recommendation from staff,

580
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,660
but that doesn't mean moving forward

581
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,413
that staff only presents
the PAB modification.

582
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,413
- Okay, hold on,

583
00:29:12,413 --> 00:29:13,770
I'm following Robert's rules of order.

584
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,110
Robert, Robert has a comment

585
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,360
and he hasn't spoken on
this topic yet, and we have.

586
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,620
So, Robert, go ahead.

587
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,060
- I just wanna bring in mind

588
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,420
that basically we don't change anything,

589
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,040
we're just fact checkers.

590
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,550
If we find something,
it goes back to them,

591
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,250
and they look at it and see
if we're right or wrong.

592
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,830
They may have overlooked
something, sometimes they don't.

593
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,970
Most of the time they don't.

594
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,953
But we're here just to see if they did.

595
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,410
And if we accept it,

596
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,230
then they go and say,
"Okay, it's done right."

597
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,630
It goes through the
commission, they vote on it.

598
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,080
But we just check what they're doing,

599
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,820
we don't change anything.

600
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,870
- Well, I guess disagree a
little bit with you, Robert,

601
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,240
right, in the sense that
the city charter outlines

602
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,390
our responsibilities and
obligations and powers and duties

603
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:05,010
and those include considering or proposing

604
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:08,550
any sort of amendments to
the city comprehensive plan.

605
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,290
And you know, whether or not

606
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:13,860
that's a power that we
historically executed as a board,

607
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,210
like it is in the city charter

608
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,100
and it is part of our own responsibility.

609
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,800
And I guess regardless of that, you know,

610
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,260
the outline in the Florida State Code

611
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,187
is that we're an advisory board

612
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:24,990
and we have an obligation and a duty

613
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,990
to advise the City
Commission on these actions.

614
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,230
I mean, the reason we exist is
to kind of give citizen input

615
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,933
to these choices before they
go before the commission.

616
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:40,370
I'm trying to better understand
how that process works

617
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:43,680
and what we can do to
most be effective in this.

618
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,300
- The process works like
this, we're here to help them.

619
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,280
We don't really make decisions,

620
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,830
we don't make decisions, they do.

621
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,807
We're here to look at what
they brought to us and say,

622
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:59,730
"Hey, did I dot my T, cross my I,"

623
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,900
and we say yes or no.

624
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,730
- Well, I, yeah-
- In some respect.

625
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,563
- I'm gonna say

626
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:07,470
I am not completely in
agreement with that, Robert,

627
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,330
in that if we think

628
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,320
that something goes
against the best interest,

629
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,430
because again, as Alex said,

630
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,990
we are representing our community-

631
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,143
- That's part of our job.

632
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:18,000
- And the citizens.

633
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,010
- We don't make the decisions
to say, "Change it."

634
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,240
- Okay, so just to-

635
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,420
- Go, ahead, Kalanit,
just to briefly clarify,

636
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:29,340
your role is to send an advisory opinion

637
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,870
to City Commission, that's it.

638
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,703
- Yep.

639
00:31:34,703 --> 00:31:38,340
- So what you recommend to City Commission

640
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,840
may at times be different

641
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,470
than what staff recommends
to City Commission.

642
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,930
And it is up to City Commission

643
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:49,440
to decide between those options,

644
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,950
if that's even what's before them.

645
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,910
- And the city has overruled
our opinions in the past

646
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,369
on things gone the other way.

647
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:00,720
- They've overruled staff
recommendations too.

648
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,553
- Sorry?

649
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:04,560
- They've also overruled staff
recommendations too as well.

650
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,740
Yes, it's not just you guys.

651
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,403
- Yeah, and I guess,
so my question is how-

652
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,430
- How do you ensure that whatever is-

653
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:20,040
- That our proposals
are presented in the way

654
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,133
that we think is most
effective to the commission?

655
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:32,820
It sounds like the basic
operating procedure

656
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,790
is anything we do in the PAB,

657
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,560
it's already kind of
part of public record,

658
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,940
it's part of our own minutes

659
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,530
and the minutes from our meeting

660
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:43,290
are kind of part of the packet
that goes into the agenda

661
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,040
for any of the corresponding
items that go before the board.

662
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,563
- Correct.
- Are there any-

663
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,450
- Can you have a greater influence

664
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,927
than what is decided by the board, no.

665
00:32:57,927 --> 00:33:00,720
- No, not then what is
decided by the board.

666
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,349
But is there, I guess like, do other-

667
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:06,003
- I mean, by PAB, your board,

668
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,930
your casting a recommendation.

669
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,250
- Yes.

670
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,800
- And is your concern that it
is not presented accurately,

671
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,480
and you wanna make sure

672
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,913
that it is presented accurately?

673
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,023
What is the disconnect?

674
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,562
- Yeah, I guess the question is-

675
00:33:28,562 --> 00:33:31,598
- How do you ensure that
it is portrayed accurately?

676
00:33:31,598 --> 00:33:35,160
- That it's portrayed, yes, accurately,

677
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:40,160
or yeah, portrayed in a way
that yeah, portrayed accurately.

678
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,090
- I think staff does a good job

679
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,820
of giving the PAB recommendations

680
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,693
in your capacity as a citizen.

681
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,190
You can absolutely rate your
commissioners in advance

682
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,743
and dispute the findings.

683
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,660
- I guess, yeah, I don't know.

684
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:17,660
I guess, like, do other municipalities,

685
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,480
is there ever, you know,
representatives from the PAB

686
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,420
to present the PABs actions
before the commission?

687
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,493
- I can speak on that in another city

688
00:34:30,493 --> 00:34:34,950
that I was a board liaison,
my same role here to as well,

689
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:39,690
no, because it can invalidate
that planning that local,

690
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,340
it can invalidate potentially

691
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,590
the action that the board takes

692
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,410
when you have individual
Planning Advisory Board members

693
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:51,030
conflict acting on changing
or modifying motions

694
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,890
and things that were made previously,

695
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:57,890
when you have actual representatives
coming as PAB members

696
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,580
to those city council meetings,

697
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,160
to those City Commission meetings

698
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,070
where you're essentially
potentially a conflict

699
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:08,700
where you are modifying
changing the action

700
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,580
that was taken by the
Planning Advisory Board.

701
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,250
It's also potentially for
the applicant too as well.

702
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,900
'cause they're moving
forward in good faith

703
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,150
that their item was presented

704
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,710
to the Planning Advisory Board.

705
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,150
There were motions that were made,

706
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,560
there were conditions that were made,

707
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,230
there may have been
modifications that were made,

708
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,550
and then now it moves forward

709
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,890
to a city counselor, City Commission.

710
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:33,660
And you have of Planning
Advisory Board member now,

711
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,120
and you're talking to the City Commission,

712
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,650
presenting a potential conflict

713
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,390
that there are modifications or things

714
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:43,740
that are happening outside of
that Planning Advisory Board

715
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,670
as a body, it's a
potential risk liability,

716
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,520
and it's also to the applicant
too that they can come back

717
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,380
and say potentially

718
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,100
that if that project doesn't
get approved, what have you,

719
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,890
because of statements
and things that were made

720
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,840
by a Planning Advisory Board member

721
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,600
outside of a Planning
Advisory Board meeting,

722
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,240
that could clearly invalidate that project

723
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,240
and grounds for that city
organization to be liable,

724
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,790
'cause you're making potentially changes

725
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,203
or modifications outside of this board.

726
00:36:14,203 --> 00:36:17,100
- I'm sorry, what were the
changes and modifications

727
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,260
that you believe I made?

728
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,940
- No, to answer your question

729
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,370
about the reason why we just have to,

730
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,660
during the City Commission meeting,

731
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,407
we have to factually state,

732
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:29,947
"This went to the Planning
Advisory Board on this day.

733
00:36:29,947 --> 00:36:32,970
"This was a recommendation,
this was the conditions."

734
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:36,120
Matter of fact, that was it.

735
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,390
- And then if we, but
if we pass an amendment.

736
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,220
- Which was included in the staff report,

737
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,290
which was also presented
to the City Commission

738
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,840
regarding this particular item.

739
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,960
- And that's the extent
of the presentation

740
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,173
that will ever be made.

741
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,660
- Correct.

742
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,630
- Let me ask again, just for
clarification purposes, Alex,

743
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,380
if I understand what you're saying,

744
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,920
let's say we take an action,

745
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,960
we vote on it, we approve something,

746
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,640
and we feel very strongly about it

747
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,220
and we've had a lot of discussion
and maybe it's unanimous

748
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,380
and we all feel very strongly about this.

749
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,400
And so Brenda and her
team go to the commission

750
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,520
and they present it in a factual manner

751
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,870
because they don't have, you know,

752
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,670
maybe the passion or whatever behind,

753
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,710
whatever it is, whatever it is, okay?

754
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,033
And they present it.

755
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,620
Are you concerned that the
com City Commission hears it

756
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,990
and they only see the
black and white details

757
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,430
of what was happening?

758
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,230
They don't hear the discussion

759
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,570
or all of the whys and wherefores

760
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,880
of why we voted necessarily.

761
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,840
So therefore the message
isn't, or not the message,

762
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,770
but the intent isn't conveyed adequately

763
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,627
to the City Commission
so that they're thinking,

764
00:37:49,627 --> 00:37:53,130
"Okay, based on the numbers,
I'm gonna vote against it."

765
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,930
Again, this is all hypothetical.

766
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:55,980
- Yeah.

767
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,870
- Versus somebody, you know,

768
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:01,680
we all felt very strongly we
really want this to happen,

769
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,107
and then the city, the staff says,

770
00:38:05,107 --> 00:38:06,720
"This happened, this
happened, this happened,"

771
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,520
and they hear it very cut and dried.

772
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:12,360
And so is that your concern

773
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,910
that then they don't hear
all the why's and wherefores,

774
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,040
they just see the actions
that we're taking?

775
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,260
- Yes, I'm trying to, I'm trying to,

776
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,130
I like what you're saying.

777
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,470
Yeah, like, hypothetical future scenario,

778
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,820
something comes before the board,

779
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,200
we feel very passionate about it,

780
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,180
we have extensive conversations about it,

781
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,880
we suggested amendment that we think

782
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,730
brings it in alignment with
the comprehensive plan.

783
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,790
I guess again, 'cause I'm
relatively new to this,

784
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:39,090
what I've observed now and my
understanding going forward

785
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,160
is all that will kind of get communicated

786
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,480
to the commission at that point
is sort of like our minutes.

787
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,660
It might be a couple sentences,
you know, after discussion,

788
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,670
the PAB proposed an amendment

789
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,580
to the thing that does
x, you know, one sentence

790
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,710
and then in the chambers
at the City Commission,

791
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,660
the following City Commission meeting,

792
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,200
my expectation going forward the,

793
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,600
my understanding is that the city staff

794
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,970
will present the sort of original report

795
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,040
that we heard before our board

796
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,750
and then say the PAB
proposed an amendment to do x

797
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,873
and voted, you know, 301.

798
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,650
My understanding at this point
is that's the sort of extent

799
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:27,090
of what happens here

800
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:30,090
that will go before the City Commission.

801
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,520
- I think it's supposed
to be kind of a dragnet

802
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,320
just the facts kind of thing.

803
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,940
That they're supposed to present.

804
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,430
But Kalanit, did you have
something you wanted to add?

805
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,990
- Just briefly.
- Okay.

806
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:43,560
- And I don't mean this
to be kumbaya or anything,

807
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,090
but I think it's part

808
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:48,753
of the democratic
political process, right?

809
00:39:51,628 --> 00:39:54,390
You're tasked with
bringing a recommendation

810
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,800
to City Commission

811
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,660
and then it's left to the
public to then come forward

812
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:05,010
and say whatever it is they have to say

813
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,410
in support or in opposition

814
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,873
to the agenda item proposed.

815
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:12,930
- Sorry, go ahead.

816
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,870
Okay, so again, just to clarify, again,

817
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,450
is there any problem if any board members

818
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,790
wants to come to a City
Commission meeting,

819
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,010
speak on the record?
- Absolutely not.

820
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,630
- As a private citizen and state,

821
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,460
I'm not representing the board.

822
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,550
This is my opinion about this
and this is what we should do.

823
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:34,550
- No, I mean, it is absolutely
within everybody's right

824
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,410
to go as a private citizen

825
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,563
and say whatever they have to say.

826
00:40:43,215 --> 00:40:47,040
But I understand what you're saying, Alex,

827
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,860
and it can be frustrating at times,

828
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:54,860
but I think the idea is, you as a board,

829
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:03,710
you are charted with
bringing a recommendation

830
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,163
to City Commission.

831
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,840
I understand the frustration
if it's not articulated

832
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,390
as well as you would like it to be

833
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,900
either written or verbally,

834
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,900
but at the end it is just like
you said, the facts, right?

835
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:26,430
We recommend with
conditions, blah, blah blah,

836
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,700
and then it goes to City Commission.

837
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,040
And at that point it is open to the,

838
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,583
we don't get much public here,

839
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,450
but you know, at City Commission,

840
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,490
that is definitely the opportunity.

841
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:44,490
- So it's not the staff's
job responsibility

842
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:48,840
or even prerogative to sell the idea to

843
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,703
the city commission, correct?
- It's a conflict

844
00:41:49,703 --> 00:41:52,410
because it can begin seen as favoritism

845
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,390
over one projects over another.

846
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,990
This is why it has to be
matter of fact and factual.

847
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:01,260
It can't be where there's a perception

848
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,350
where there's some level of favoritism,

849
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:08,040
you know, overly, you know,
with one project over another.

850
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,790
You have to understand
that perception too,

851
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:15,870
that there cannot be
any type of favoritism

852
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,030
or any type of perception of that.

853
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:21,780
So as Kalanit is saying, as a
private citizen, absolutely,

854
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,290
but it presents liability
and issues and problems

855
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,600
if you go before the City Commission

856
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,383
as a Planning Advisory Board member,

857
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:35,700
it causes problems
potentially for that project

858
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,013
and for that applicant.

859
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:43,013
It's a conflict really, because
it's that potential, again,

860
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,250
decisions were made

861
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,520
and it's also respecting
the Planning Advisory Board

862
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,980
as a whole too as well

863
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,450
and not an individual

864
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:55,833
where you have your own
individual interest as a citizen.

865
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:00,030
So that way there's not
any potential conflict

866
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:02,670
where you are presenting
to the City Commission

867
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,860
outside a Planning Advisory Board.

868
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,120
It could potentially, again,

869
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,730
be a liability for the city as well.

870
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:12,483
- So I have a solution potentially,

871
00:43:18,454 --> 00:43:21,690
if there are motions of this board

872
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:26,310
that are different than
what is proposed by staff,

873
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:28,980
I think that those motions

874
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,673
should be very specific and detailed

875
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:41,010
and therefore the record
will speak for itself

876
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,260
and there won't be ambiguities.

877
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:48,260
And we did that for, we made
it separate as Capital Fox.

878
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:50,940
- Yeah, and maybe we disagree on that.

879
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,430
I was both at the PAB boarding

880
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,080
and then I was at the
City Commission meeting

881
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,550
and I don't think anyone,

882
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,380
any of the members of
the public in that room

883
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,110
who are the people who
supposedly can speak then

884
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,520
to the action that we're taking.

885
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,080
I don't think any of them understood

886
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,550
that we amended the proposal.

887
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,960
I don't think any of the commissioners,

888
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,760
at least from the discussion

889
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,170
that happened in the commission meeting,

890
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:12,510
understood any of the action that we took

891
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:14,700
or the discussion that we had.

892
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,710
And so that makes it hard

893
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:19,980
to feel though democracy
could play its role.

894
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,890
- Regrettably that is
the peril of democracy.

895
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:24,450
- Yeah.

896
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:27,990
- Unfortunately if there's
not an educated populace,

897
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:32,990
then there cannot be
any informed decisions.

898
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,468
- Yeah.

899
00:44:34,468 --> 00:44:37,503
- By policy makers, but
that is a broader problem.

900
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,510
- And it sounds like, yes, okay.

901
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:47,280
So it sounds like, it sounds
like going forward in so much

902
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,900
as we, as a board feel

903
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,580
as though an amendment might be necessary

904
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,610
to bring things in alignment
with the comprehensive plan,

905
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:00,030
it sounds like we should
try to make such amendments

906
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:04,573
as sort of as detailed
and impactful as possible

907
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:13,710
that will be brought before the board.

908
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,230
And then it does sound
like we have every right,

909
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,770
as an individual citizen to
speak at City Commission.

910
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:22,320
But we need to be very careful

911
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,040
to not speak as members of
the Planning Advisory Board

912
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,110
before the City Commission

913
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:30,120
as that would create
some kind of conflict.

914
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:30,953
- Correct.

915
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,067
- Thank you, anyone else?

916
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,200
If not, do we have a motion to adjourn?

917
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,670
- Motion to adjourn.
- Motion to adjourn.

918
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,133
- I heard Alex actually,
do we have a second?

919
00:45:47,348 --> 00:45:48,181
- I second.

920
00:45:48,181 --> 00:45:50,100
- We have a second from Aaron.

921
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,600
- All in favor, please say aye.

922
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,470
- Aye.
- Aye.

923
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,243
Meeting adjourned, 6:48, thank you.
