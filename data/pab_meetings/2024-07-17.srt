1
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,640
- Let turn my mic on.

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,050
Good evening everyone.

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,390
We're gonna call the meeting to order.

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,550
If you could please stand
for a moment of silence

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,323
and for our national anthem.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,360
I'm sorry, pledge of allegiance.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,730
I pledge allegiance

8
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,507
to the flag of the
United States of America

9
00:00:35,507 --> 00:00:38,070
and to the republic for which he stands,

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,070
one nation under God, indivisible,

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,113
with liberty and justice for all.

12
00:00:48,237 --> 00:00:51,480
All right, I just wanna remind everyone

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,643
to please silence all mobile devices.

14
00:00:55,146 --> 00:00:57,180
We have no minutes.

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,100
We have nothing under old business.

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,940
So we will begin with our new business 5A,

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,790
public hearing ordinance
amending the future land use map

18
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,350
designation from single family,

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,511
low density residential to institutional.

20
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:15,511
Yes, good evening, this is
"Future Land Use Amendment".

21
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,954
It's been an, the institutional
future land use designation,

22
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,840
(indistinct),

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
has been established
within the general area

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,953
to the property to the west.

25
00:01:27,692 --> 00:01:30,540
This institutional future land substation

26
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,679
can accommodate semi-public uses,

27
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:37,320
including schools,
educational institutions,

28
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,770
civic facilities, and cultural facilities.

29
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,890
The property owner intends
to utilize the property

30
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,930
as a childcare facility.

31
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,450
There has been a
conditional use application

32
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,910
that has been submitted, however,

33
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,360
that separate application
has be placed on hold

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,220
until this land use amendment

35
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,180
and the following item to change
the zoning on the property

36
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,283
is approved by the city commission.

37
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,080
At this time, the proposed
future land use change

38
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,040
to institutional is compatible
with the zoning map amendment

39
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,470
that you're gonna be hearing
during the next item,

40
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,260
and it's compatible with
the surrounding area.

41
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,080
Staff is recommending
approval at this time,

42
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,470
and is available for any
questions that you may have.

43
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,303
Thank you.

44
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:25,800
Is there any discussion from the board?

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,853
Any questions?

46
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:30,573
Anyone from the audience
that has a question?

47
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,720
Okay.

48
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,460
At this time I'd ask for
the board to disclose

49
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,200
if they have any ex parte communication,

50
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,078
have visited the site, or is
there any conflict of interest?

51
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:42,730
If not, I'd ask for motion to approve.

52
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:46,170
- I make motion to approve.

53
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,689
- Thank you, seconded.

54
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:49,500
- Second.
- All right.

55
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,640
All in favor?

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,750
- Aye.
- Aye.

57
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,330
Having heard, oh, sorry, opposed?

58
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,123
Having heard none, the
motion carries approved.

59
00:02:58,882 --> 00:03:02,013
5B, ordinance amending the zoning map.

60
00:03:04,012 --> 00:03:07,350
This is the companion zoning map amendment

61
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,080
to change the zoning
designation on this property,

62
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,526
which is about a little over a half acre.

63
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,700
It's on the south side of Patrick Street

64
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,250
as shown on the map exhibit.

65
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,778
The property in that structure

66
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:23,778
was constructed as a church
originally back in 1994.

67
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:26,850
There was another
conditional use application

68
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,950
that came in in 1997,

69
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,510
and that 1997 application,

70
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,510
they expanded the church to
a seating capacity of 54.

71
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:40,923
That building is about 3,200 square feet.

72
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,090
It has 22 parking spaces.

73
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,090
There was a buffer that
was requested back in 1997

74
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,100
that waived the buffer
requirement on the southern

75
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,606
and on the eastern side of the property.

76
00:03:55,606 --> 00:03:58,189
(indistinct).

77
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,760
That buffer on the south side was waived

78
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,070
due to the proximity
of the retention pond,

79
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,080
the retention pond, it felt at the time

80
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,190
provided a buffer from any
of the adjacent residential.

81
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,870
So the city commission at the time

82
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,330
granted that waiver on the south side,

83
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,340
and on the east side of the property,

84
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,840
instead of placing a wall,

85
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,633
there was a fence that was approved.

86
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:25,650
The current property
owner currently right now

87
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,260
has submitted a building permit for the

88
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,760
installment of aluminum fence

89
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,270
on the west side of the
property adjacent to the ditch

90
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,330
as the intended uses
support childcare facility

91
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,910
that fences for tag security protection

92
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,280
for the children on the west side,

93
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,933
because it's an open ditch.

94
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,320
As stated before, the property intends

95
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,860
to utilize the existing
structure as a daycare facility.

96
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,705
Now you, as the planning advisory board,

97
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:53,880
that condition use application

98
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,250
will come before you at a later date,

99
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,680
again, this land use amendment

100
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,230
and rezoning has to take place first

101
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,230
to establish the land use and the zoning.

102
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,570
At this time, this zoning map amendment

103
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,327
is compatible with the
future land use designation,

104
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:12,030
and therefore staff is
recommending approval

105
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,423
subject to the approval
of the land use first.

106
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,490
- Thank you Brenda.

107
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,460
Any discussion or
questions from the board?

108
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,293
None.

109
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:22,600
All right, motion to approve.

110
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,673
I'm sorry, from the audience.

111
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:27,640
I forget that all the time.

112
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,968
Sorry.
(speaker chuckles)

113
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:30,273
Motion.

114
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,283
Motion to approve.

115
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:35,427
- I'll make a motion to approve.

116
00:05:35,427 --> 00:05:36,439
- Thank you.

117
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,290
Second.
- Second.

118
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,242
- All in favor?
- Aye.

119
00:05:39,242 --> 00:05:41,070
- Any unopposed?

120
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,220
Having heard none,
motion care is approved.

121
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:49,860
All right, under public hearings, we have.

122
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,710
- So I guess before we
move on from new business,

123
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,873
I was hoping to make a motion,

124
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,590
so I guess with new people on the board

125
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,531
and just sort of in general to

126
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:04,080
make us a more effective body.

127
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,090
I was hoping to make a motion

128
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,250
to add an agenda item for our next meeting

129
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,320
where we could maybe start reading through

130
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,060
and discussing different chapters
of the comprehensive plan.

131
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,610
So I was thinking we could
start that next meeting

132
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,970
by discussing chapter
one, future land use.

133
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,060
And so that's my motion to add the agenda,

134
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,070
to add an item to the
agenda at our next meeting

135
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,630
to discuss the first chapter

136
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,330
of Kissimmee's comprehensive plan.

137
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,853
- So to add it as a motion, 'cause if we,

138
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:39,420
and you can clarify,

139
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,840
to add it as a motion to
indicate that there's some action

140
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,130
or just general discussion,

141
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,440
'cause we can bring it as
a general discussion item,

142
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,763
but if you add it as a.
- Yeah.

143
00:06:48,763 --> 00:06:49,740
- An agenda item.

144
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,940
- My intention is to add it
as a general discussion item.

145
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,170
I was under the impression
I need to make a motion to

146
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,090
suggest a new agenda item.

147
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,660
So, the motion is to add the agenda item,

148
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,770
but I'm perfectly fine

149
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,370
with the agenda item being
under general discussion.

150
00:07:10,027 --> 00:07:12,720
My hope was, you know,

151
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,730
because we've got sort of
new members and things,

152
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,670
and also to try to make
our body more effective,

153
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,290
my understanding is the mandate

154
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,590
for the planning advisory board is to be

155
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,950
a citizen advisory board whose
duty it is to ensure that

156
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,630
the decisions coming before our board

157
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,880
and keeping with the
city's comprehensive plan.

158
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,580
So the city's comprehensive
plan is a document that,

159
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,950
you know, is produced
every decade or something

160
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,850
and we can all get a copy from Brenda.

161
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,710
I mean, it's a big thing,
it's a big document,

162
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,630
but it is the document

163
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,150
that governs our actions on the board.

164
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,150
And so it's also in coming
in the coming year or two,

165
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,810
Kissimmee is going to

166
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,747
have to review the comprehensive plan.

167
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:55,800
And so I thought it might
be an appropriate time

168
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,940
to start reading

169
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,010
through the existing
objectives in the plan,

170
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,249
to familiarize ourselves
with them as well as to

171
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:07,249
discuss whether, have
an open discussion about

172
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,678
whether there were things
we might wanna suggest the

173
00:08:09,678 --> 00:08:12,480
city considered going forward.

174
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,200
- Actually, one would enjoy
being able to understand, but,

175
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,670
and to learn more and
to be more effective.

176
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,010
So for me, I just, how would that,

177
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,450
again, explaining where it would go

178
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,190
and how it would play out.

179
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,893
So I wanna recall also to the board

180
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:29,040
that we had discussed
about having a workshop,

181
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,300
but we postponed it

182
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,570
because we knew that we had
two appointments coming up,

183
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,420
I recall.
- Yes.

184
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,700
- So I think bringing it back
to the meeting yes, will help,

185
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,743
but then also this may be fitting

186
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:43,470
to maybe discuss a workshop.

187
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,713
And we had some internal discussion

188
00:08:45,713 --> 00:08:48,859
to have the workshop
be two parts, twofold.

189
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:53,859
The first part to go over
ethics, Robert's rules

190
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,520
just in general as a
planning advisory board.

191
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,294
And more so with (indistinct)
about Florida statutes.

192
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:06,897
And then the second part to go
into the comprehensive plan,

193
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:10,102
correlation with the zoning map amendment,

194
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:12,210
the different types of applications.

195
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,900
So it may be where we discuss

196
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,060
a time that we have a workshop.

197
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,763
Typically what we do for the workshop

198
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:23,490
is that we schedule it to
wherever we have no items.

199
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,350
So that way the entire hour,

200
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,930
because we think an hour
is usually is tapped

201
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,210
because we know a lot of
information coming at you

202
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,602
that we dedicate

203
00:09:32,602 --> 00:09:34,710
and look at our schedule to see

204
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,737
when we don't have an
item that's scheduled

205
00:09:36,737 --> 00:09:40,087
or moving forward to the city commission,

206
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:43,590
and to reserve that night
for a workshop number one,

207
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,860
part one, and do another
workshop part two.

208
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,530
That's just a suggestion I think

209
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,254
that we can separate it out to where

210
00:09:52,254 --> 00:09:55,590
(indistinct) will go through
Florida statutes, ethics

211
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,030
and those types of things,

212
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,264
just as a board member
for you to be aware of.

213
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:03,450
And then with the comprehensive plan,

214
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,550
because this is a planning advisory board.

215
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,823
Exactly, the comprehensive
plan and zoning.

216
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:15,194
- So I would, to piggyback
on what Brenda just said,

217
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:20,260
I would suggest we do that first.

218
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,317
- Sure.
- To get everybody,

219
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:23,640
you know, on the same page

220
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,520
so we understand what we're all doing.

221
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,921
And then, now when you're proposing,

222
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,643
like you said, chapter one,

223
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:37,470
is your idea to systematically
chapter by chapter.

224
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,580
- That would be the idea, yeah.

225
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,870
- Okay.

226
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,550
- But you know, the company's of plan

227
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,690
as a whole is quite large,

228
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,430
so it feels like breaking it up would be.

229
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,052
- It's quite large.
- Yeah.

230
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:51,180
So I'm willing to retract
that motion at this time.

231
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,869
But maybe it'd be a good time,

232
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:56,307
you wanna discuss now the future?

233
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:57,453
Yeah.

234
00:10:59,054 --> 00:11:01,697
So I'll retract my motion at this moment.

235
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:04,500
(people laughing)

236
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,290
- Hello everyone, my name is Aaron Sabino.

237
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,700
I'm now a resident here
in the city of Kissimmee

238
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,710
for four years.

239
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,840
The reason why I even moved to Kissimmee,

240
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,560
because I truly read the
comprehensive plans for the city,

241
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,707
it's a 50 year build out.

242
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:26,707
One thing I wanted to bring
to the attention of you all is

243
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,210
do we need to have training

244
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,700
and understanding during a public meeting

245
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,030
where we should be addressing
the topics of people

246
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,140
who are submitting various amendments

247
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,480
to move their initiative forward,

248
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,888
or how, wherever we wanna
misutilize the land or whatever

249
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:47,883
to that regard.

250
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,921
But I don't mind if you guys

251
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:55,110
would like to give me some slides or give,

252
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,640
or anyone that's new.

253
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,453
I would love to get
myself full up to speed.

254
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,933
I don't really watch TV, I read.

255
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:10,264
But more importantly, I
want to advise the board,

256
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,990
I'm here to be fully engaged.

257
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,430
I am fully cognizant of
what's going on with the city,

258
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,823
which gave me the initiative
to be a part of this board.

259
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,140
That's where I stand.

260
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,630
I think that having some understanding

261
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,000
of what the comprehensive plans are

262
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,470
is very important for anybody
who sits on this board.

263
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,924
In addition training I think
is very important to know

264
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,620
how your duties and responsibilities

265
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,140
being apart of this program are important.

266
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,510
But I'm not sure if it is necessary

267
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,094
for us to use this during public time

268
00:12:48,094 --> 00:12:50,100
when we have the public here as well.

269
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,000
Maybe that could be something

270
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,796
that could be done on like a Saturday.

271
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:55,800
Is that allowed to be
done or, I'm not sure?

272
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,898
- Yeah.

273
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:58,542
Part of my, I yield back,

274
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:01,260
with Florida Sunshine
and things like that,

275
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,780
if we were to discuss items

276
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,270
or topics that might
come before the board,

277
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,000
we're required to have those
meetings in a public forum.

278
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,541
But we can check with the city attorney.

279
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,374
- Yes, absolutely.

280
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:16,290
Like, it's best for us
to do it in this forum.

281
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,837
And you know, we do have the luxury of

282
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:23,640
not having too many items
on each of our agendas,

283
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,083
so we can schedule a time for education.

284
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:31,410
And I love the fact that you've
read the comprehensive plan.

285
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,280
I applaud that.

286
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,240
I think one thing that
Brenda will talk about

287
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,735
when we go through the
education process is,

288
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,650
you know, there's the comprehensive plan

289
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:47,040
and then there's the land
development regulations,

290
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,040
and there's how those two
things mesh with each other,

291
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,291
and also our city process.

292
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,610
Before anything comes before this board,

293
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:04,610
it goes through a pretty
rigorous vetting process by staff

294
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:08,340
and it's not just internal staff,

295
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:13,121
it's also Toho School Board, KUA.

296
00:14:13,121 --> 00:14:17,883
There are many different
agencies, sometimes the county,

297
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,993
well, this sounds very weird, sorry.

298
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,463
Who are looking at these,

299
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:30,330
what comes to you as agenda items.

300
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,330
So we'll talk about all
of that in further detail,

301
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:40,730
but I think it's best for
us to do it in this forum.

302
00:14:43,813 --> 00:14:46,860
But I think what you're saying is that,

303
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,335
that's why with the workshop,

304
00:14:48,335 --> 00:14:51,750
if we know that there aren't any items,

305
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,348
I see what you're saying,

306
00:14:53,348 --> 00:14:55,230
for instance, if we have multiple items

307
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,030
and we have folks that have the items

308
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,300
and to take up that time
with the education component,

309
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,911
that's why we're suggesting
to have a workshop.

310
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,730
Those workshops, they have to be public

311
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,050
and we have to advertise

312
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,540
that they're open to the general public.

313
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,780
But it's a general education
session for the general public,

314
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,552
there won't be any items,
we won't be asking you to

315
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:18,720
make any recommendations
on a particular item.

316
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,631
We will know, usually,

317
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:25,380
depending on the submittal
applications, where the entire,

318
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,340
again, the entire meeting
will be just for education,

319
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,990
it's not just for you as a board,

320
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,260
but it's also the general
public is welcome to as well.

321
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,300
When it's a workshop, it's a workshop.

322
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,480
No different than city
commission workshops too as well.

323
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,800
Those are all public, general
public are welcome to attend.

324
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,660
But it doesn't take away, for instance,

325
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,330
you know Mrs. Garcia, where they have,

326
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,335
there's a certain
timeliness and expectation

327
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:54,718
for these applications to
come in that we have to vet,

328
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:56,280
we have to discuss it

329
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,900
and not unduly delay their applications

330
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,570
that they have submitted.

331
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,010
So I understand what you're saying,

332
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,650
but I think that workshop can be that,

333
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,260
where we can have this
for multiple members

334
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,560
of you at one time, it
has to be in the Sunshine,

335
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,940
but we can do that as a workshop

336
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,110
and not take away from
anyone else's opportunity

337
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,540
for their application to be delayed

338
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,710
or to have to be by the wayside for that.

339
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,543
That's what those workshops for.

340
00:16:27,543 --> 00:16:28,785
We can have multiple,

341
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:32,280
there's nothing to say that
we can have a maximum amount

342
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,070
of workshops, if we decide
that we can have a third one,

343
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,782
we can schedule a third workshop

344
00:16:36,782 --> 00:16:39,690
or even a fourth or even
quarterly, however we see fit.

345
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,090
We can look at our schedules

346
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,643
and dedicate the time to
have multiple workshops.

347
00:16:47,045 --> 00:16:50,283
- Understood, and noted
for the record, thank you.

348
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,193
And understood and noted.

349
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,383
- And also for the new
members also any questions

350
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:02,280
that you have that are in
general, you are more than welcome

351
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,585
to bring them up before
us in this public forum,

352
00:17:06,585 --> 00:17:10,110
or you can email me or Brenda

353
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:14,610
with any specific questions
about process, procedure,

354
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,233
even details.

355
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:20,730
So we are always
available to you as staff.

356
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,100
Yes, you can do that,

357
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,473
as long as it's individually, you can,

358
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,370
and if it's your project
planner, what have you

359
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,080
'cause we have a number of planners

360
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,617
will get to that during discussion,

361
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:35,313
you know, we have two board members,

362
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:36,526
we also have new planning staff

363
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:37,359
that I want to introduce to you as well.

364
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,770
But you'll be assigned a
certain planner to as well

365
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,665
for that particular application.

366
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:46,860
So you can email them with
any questions or concerns

367
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,390
that you may have ahead of the meeting.

368
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,742
No differently within the
commission meetings too as well.

369
00:17:51,742 --> 00:17:56,040
I get questions sometimes
from the city manager

370
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,770
of a particular item before the meeting,

371
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,383
and that's vetted prior to the meeting.

372
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:05,804
- Considering sometimes when
we don't have an agenda,

373
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:09,787
can we still have, quote, a workshop?

374
00:18:09,787 --> 00:18:10,915
- That's the idea.

375
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:12,994
That's the idea.
- To get 'em working

376
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:15,510
little by little to get 'em up to speed.

377
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,990
So, 'cause if you could hit
'em with the whole book,

378
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,267
(indistinct)

379
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,810
and they won't know what
they're talking about.

380
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,450
- But that leads to my other
component, communication.

381
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,993
So when we send out that email,

382
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:34,833
that email is our primary contact.

383
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:39,118
We have to make sure ahead of time

384
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,653
because we have to advertise,

385
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:42,990
and notification has to
be sent of a workshop.

386
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,610
We have to confirm that
that quorum ahead of time.

387
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:49,470
So we need at least four
voting members to confirm.

388
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,250
So there is a timeliness, we
have to know ahead of time

389
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,640
that when you are attending to as well

390
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,200
'cause we need a minimum of four.

391
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,260
We cannot convene as a board,
whether it be a workshop

392
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,140
or a regular meeting with
less than four members.

393
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,323
- I know this is voluntary,

394
00:19:05,323 --> 00:19:08,700
but if it's a workshop, it
should be mandatory that we show

395
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,538
because it's where everybody's benefits.

396
00:19:11,538 --> 00:19:13,945
But.
- Yeah, I agree with you.

397
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:14,908
(people laughing)

398
00:19:14,908 --> 00:19:16,642
I agree with you.

399
00:19:16,642 --> 00:19:18,060
- Every meeting.

400
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,977
- But it's.

401
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,975
- We can't people to come.
- Yeah.

402
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:24,770
- Unfortunately.

403
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,614
So.
- I had to say it though.

404
00:19:26,614 --> 00:19:27,447
- I wish.

405
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:30,640
All right, moving on.

406
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,520
- Okay.
- So other discussion,

407
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,630
I wanna personally say
that I appreciate the board

408
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,264
and the staff during the time
that I was unable to be here.

409
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:44,160
The last couple months, my
father has been in hospice

410
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,560
and then I was also doing
school of government,

411
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,837
so it butted up against this.

412
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:50,460
So, for the times that I wasn't here,

413
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,750
I know that I did clearly tell you,

414
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,058
but just so that you guys are aware,

415
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:55,590
I do appreciate that this
board was understanding

416
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,707
of what was happening with me.

417
00:19:57,707 --> 00:20:01,080
And just for clarity, I
wanna point out, once again,

418
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,260
we are going to have during
our regular meeting times

419
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,159
workshops to discuss
Robert's rules of orders,

420
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,070
the land development
code, all of these things

421
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,450
that some of us need some
refreshing on or some clarity on.

422
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,000
And then your second
part of your question is,

423
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,030
could we have a copy of it?

424
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,340
So is that something that
you can provide to us?

425
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,210
Absolutely.

426
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,590
We have, yes, we have a link
to the comprehensive plan.

427
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,270
Again, it's 600,

428
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,130
I mean, if you look at
all the different elements

429
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,630
are the chapters, I think
it's seven, 800 pages.

430
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,980
- If you include all the
amendments, it's 1200.

431
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:41,470
- There you go.

432
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,040
- Which, I mean, maybe
this is now a good time,

433
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,110
once again, I'd like to request the city,

434
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,450
make the comprehensive
plan publicly available

435
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,847
on the city website if possible.

436
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:52,876
- So the website right now,

437
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,320
the last update is going through that.

438
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,020
So if we receive a request,

439
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,379
we do make it publicly accessible

440
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:03,660
and provide the link
to the general public.

441
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,493
- Yeah,

442
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:09,900
I understand that the
city is in compliance

443
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,810
with the requirement to make
it accessible upon request.

444
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,510
In the spirit of making
the comprehensive plan

445
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,560
broadly accessible,

446
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,870
I think it would be
even better if the city,

447
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,900
much like it has a link to,

448
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,030
you know, the city code, community code,

449
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,940
and it does make available a link

450
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,620
directly to the PDF for
the downtown CRA comp plan

451
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,300
and the Vine Street CRA comp plan.

452
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,690
I think it would be a good idea

453
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,030
to have the city comprehensive plan

454
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,610
and the past amendments available

455
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,453
as a link on the city website.

456
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,085
- I concur with that.

457
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:47,730
This was the first time

458
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,510
I wasn't readily available to
get the comprehensive plan.

459
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,303
I actually had to email
the city manager to get it,

460
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,123
to actually read it.

461
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,950
Normally,

462
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,930
because I worked for the
Department of Defense

463
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,510
and I travel across the country

464
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,130
and I'm staying in various cities,

465
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,100
every city, I read their
comprehensive plan.

466
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,130
It's normally readily available online.

467
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,530
This is the first time it wasn't,

468
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:17,070
so I definitely like to
piggyback off his and.

469
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,531
- We'll try to make that happen.

470
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:22,380
(indistinct)

471
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,000
Our control,

472
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,126
but we'll see what we can do.

473
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:29,700
- I think.
- To provide to you.

474
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,620
- I'm sorry, the website is
under new development now,

475
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,820
like they're making changes,

476
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,040
maybe that's something you
can suggest since you said

477
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,850
you wrote city manager just mentioned how

478
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,490
difficult it was for you and
in comparison to other cities,

479
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,781
it was readily available.

480
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:45,180
Now that we're already
working on the website,

481
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,080
this might be a good time to add that.

482
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,280
- I'm pretty sure he's fully cognizant.

483
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,113
- Yes.

484
00:22:51,113 --> 00:22:52,650
And that's what I wanna say,

485
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,546
It's been noted and there's
whole bunch of different,

486
00:22:56,546 --> 00:22:59,250
there's a test I think

487
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,770
that was actually even
sent out for that matter.

488
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,530
So I'm thinking again,
I can't speak for IT.

489
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,730
- Yeah.
- But I do know

490
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,029
that there has been reviews

491
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:12,840
with the website update too as well.

492
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,360
But I know that it's been noted,

493
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,920
I just don't know when that rollout.

494
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,056
And I do apologize for that.

495
00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:20,727
I just don't know when that rollout is,

496
00:23:20,727 --> 00:23:24,630
but we can provide an
update to give you an ETA

497
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,730
as to when they're gonna have that rollout

498
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,550
or if they're gonna make
an interim, you know,

499
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,483
temporary link that we can
provide on the website.

500
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,330
All right.

501
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,550
Next item is here from
chairman and board members.

502
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,660
I think we've already done that.

503
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,070
So.

504
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,145
Then at 6:25, we are.

505
00:23:46,145 --> 00:23:47,580
- (indistinct) something.

506
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,413
- Yes.

507
00:23:49,306 --> 00:23:50,910
- Just really quickly, I wanna from staff,

508
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,743
from city staff,

509
00:23:51,743 --> 00:23:56,743
I do want to introduce
and welcome Rebecca Marin

510
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,370
as a newest planning
advisory board member,

511
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,078
and also Aaron Sabino to as well

512
00:24:02,078 --> 00:24:04,620
(speaker laughing)

513
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,974
to our planning advisory board.

514
00:24:06,974 --> 00:24:10,529
Again, like we mentioned
to you as well, city staff,

515
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:11,879
what have you is available.

516
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,498
I want to probably,

517
00:24:14,498 --> 00:24:17,940
for emails, we'll probably
bring you some tentative dates

518
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,560
that we're looking at.

519
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,020
I'm not sure the second week of August,

520
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,840
but again, we need to make sure
that we have enough members

521
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,660
before we can confirm the workshop.

522
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,400
So it might be, I don't
know, late August, September

523
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,060
and try to figure it out,

524
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,210
and make sure that we
do have enough members.

525
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,910
With that also, I wanna
introduce additional staff

526
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,770
behind us here too as well.

527
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,960
So to my right, we have John Raven,

528
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,384
who's our new senior planner.

529
00:24:44,384 --> 00:24:46,140
It's been about a month now, I believe?

530
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,870
It's about a month now since
you've been with the city

531
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,660
joining us from Raleigh, North Carolina.

532
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,240
So welcome John.

533
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,850
Chris, well, you all know Christian Arise

534
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:00,570
is our senior planner, has been with this.

535
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,693
Ryan Althizer, actually during
the last meeting too as well,

536
00:25:03,693 --> 00:25:07,128
he's also a planner from
Fort Pierce, Florida.

537
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:11,190
Again, planners with prior experience,

538
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,420
again, run the gamut from
annexations, complexity,

539
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,300
so it is welcoming, it is long overdue.

540
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,190
I know as much as y'all
are familiar with me

541
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,663
and with my face,

542
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,660
we have a good group of planners.

543
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,900
We do have plans in place to start

544
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,900
maybe incrementally taking a look at

545
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,550
our land development code.

546
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,310
We do have a separate
long range planning team

547
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,980
that looks at the comprehensive plan,

548
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,020
Ashley Cornelson and John Handley.

549
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,390
So we do have another
separate set of planners

550
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,166
that actually part of their responsibility

551
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,550
is to coordinate directly with the state

552
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,560
to make sure we meet state requirements.

553
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,650
We do have another requirement
coming up in August.

554
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,870
But these are the current
planning team here

555
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,700
for representing the items

556
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,283
that are going to be presented to you.

557
00:26:00,343 --> 00:26:05,250
Oh, and Kayla, I'm sorry, Kayla
Smith is also too as well,

558
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,833
about three weeks or so, or I don't,

559
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:11,670
it's about three weeks or
so coming from Pompano Beach

560
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,750
there?
- Yes.

561
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,090
- From South Florida to you as well.

562
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,000
So this is the new current
planning team here.

563
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,603
And again, thank you so
much for what you all do,

564
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,359
and thank you.

565
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,200
- All right, well, welcome
to the new board members

566
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,870
and welcome to Kissimmee
those of you who are new here.

567
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,270
And now we can adjourn.

568
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,158
Okay, 6:28 we adjourn.

569
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:33,174
(speaker chuckles)

570
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,183
Motion to adjourn.

571
00:26:34,183 --> 00:26:35,569
- Motion.
- Second.

572
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:37,566
- All right, we're all set.

573
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:38,958
All in favor?

574
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:39,977
You want me to do all the.

575
00:26:39,977 --> 00:26:40,984
- Yeah, you go too.

576
00:26:40,984 --> 00:26:42,304
- All in favor?

577
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,496
- Aye.
- None opposed.

578
00:26:43,496 --> 00:26:44,329
- Aye.
