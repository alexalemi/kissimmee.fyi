1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,153
- Good evening.

2
00:00:02,153 --> 00:00:02,986
We're gonna call the meeting

3
00:00:02,986 --> 00:00:05,370
to order is 6:17 PM.

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,409
If everyone could please stand

5
00:00:06,409 --> 00:00:10,826
for a moment of silence and
the Pledge of Allegiance.

6
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:21,203
- I pledge allegiance to the flag

7
00:00:21,203 --> 00:00:23,360
of the United States of America.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,932
And to the republic for which it stands,

9
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:28,970
one nation, under God, indivisible,

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,720
with liberty and justice for all.

11
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:38,790
- As a reminder, we ask you
to silence any electronics

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,363
and ladies, to just
move on to new business.

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,711
- Hi, good evening.

14
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:50,910
This first item is

15
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,630
for an ordinance amending
the zoning map designation

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,910
for the sub property

17
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,960
from open space to multiple
family medium density

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,353
which is RC2 for the Bass Road town homes.

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,120
And there's the map of the property.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,990
This property went through
an annexation in 2019

21
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,900
as part of an interlocal
agreement with Osceola County

22
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,933
which annexed around 200 other properties.

23
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,890
And at the time the subject
property adopted the city's,

24
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,140
we used the comprehensive
plan policy, 1.1.10.5

25
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,050
to convert the county's land use

26
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,270
and zoning designation to the cities.

27
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,103
And the applicant

28
00:01:49,103 --> 00:01:52,020
at this time would like
to amend that zoning

29
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,020
from open space to RC2
for town home development.

30
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,030
And it is in compliance with
the existing future land use

31
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,700
of multifamily medium density residential.

32
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,550
So the Development Review
Committee recommended approval

33
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,273
at the May 16th, 2023 meeting.

34
00:02:18,036 --> 00:02:19,173
- Is the occupant here?

35
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:20,773
Yes, the property owner is here.

36
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,053
- Would you like to speak?

37
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:25,281
- Well.

38
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:26,897
- You'd have to come up, sorry sir.

39
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,230
State your name and address.

40
00:02:33,664 --> 00:02:35,255
- Good evening.

41
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,272
It's not the first time I
develop a property in Kissimmee.

42
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:39,105
- Your name and address.

43
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:39,938
- I'm sorry, Miguel Kaled,

44
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:44,583
2305 Edgewater Drive, Orlando
Florida 32804, College Park.

45
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,170
It's not the first time we
developed a property in Kissimmee

46
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,070
and a client of mine
acquired this piece of land.

47
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,071
And we are developing,

48
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:59,010
we are taking very good care
of developing a good product.

49
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,460
So all town houses will
be facing each other

50
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,530
and the corridor in the middle of them

51
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,530
more or less 50 feet will
have only pedestrian access.

52
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,670
And the main thing for this
is to provide the family,

53
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,490
especially if they have kids,

54
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,133
contained environment without fences.

55
00:03:21,563 --> 00:03:24,810
And all the garages
will be facing outwards

56
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,653
of the lot.

57
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,543
We have here,

58
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,330
so no cars in front of the
unit, cars will be around.

59
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,770
And I think it's a good concept.

60
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,900
We have that, we've done that before.

61
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,463
Everybody liked very much.

62
00:03:42,403 --> 00:03:44,310
And I think that's it.

63
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,465
If you have questions,
I'm ready to answer them.

64
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:49,366
- Do you have any questions?

65
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:50,793
- No.

66
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:52,273
- No

67
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,106
- Thank you so much.

68
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:55,136
- Thank you.

69
00:03:55,136 --> 00:03:58,333
- Does anyone from the audience?

70
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,000
- Quick question from the board.

71
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:07,239
There has been no ex parte
communications or site visits?

72
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,349
No complex?

73
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:11,347
Okay.

74
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:14,044
Just put it on the record, thanks.

75
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:16,470
- And to clarify we did not
receive any public comment

76
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,570
prior to this meeting.

77
00:04:18,638 --> 00:04:20,403
- Is there any conditions to it?

78
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:24,990
- The only conditions
were advisory for the

79
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,820
whenever they submit their site plan

80
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,380
just advisory comments such as,

81
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,570
it is within the conservation overlay

82
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,570
and they will need to provide
a conservation impact report.

83
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,960
And then a few other things just related

84
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,950
to site plan approval

85
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,556
but nothing related to
the zoning approval.

86
00:04:43,556 --> 00:04:44,389
- Okay.

87
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:48,741
- So do I have motion to approve?

88
00:04:48,741 --> 00:04:50,527
- I'll make a motion to approve.

89
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:51,360
- Yes.

90
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:54,111
- All in favor?

91
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:54,944
- Aye

92
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:55,880
- Aye.

93
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,379
- Anyone opposed?

94
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:58,629
Motion carries.

95
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:00,606
- Cool.

96
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:09,030
- Yes, so this next item is a request

97
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,780
for conditional use with site
specific redevelopment plan

98
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,780
for an office conversion located
at 1012 Mabbot, shown here.

99
00:05:20,307 --> 00:05:23,220
And the property is currently zoned T40

100
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,177
which allows office convert,

101
00:05:24,177 --> 00:05:29,177
or which allows office users
with a conditional use.

102
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,850
And this request is to establish an office

103
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,500
at the subject property.

104
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,040
And the building was
originally built in 1926

105
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,710
as a single family residence,

106
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,660
and has been used as this since then.

107
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,773
And the property is
approximately 0.21 acres.

108
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:50,160
The property has received some notices

109
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,160
of violation and has an
open code enforcement case

110
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,550
which went to special magistrate
on June 12th of this year.

111
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,650
And the property owners
were given a 90 day

112
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,390
extension to come into compliance

113
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,241
and this approval would be part of that.

114
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,180
And then the conversion
includes the additional

115
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,660
five parking spaces and
a paved access drive

116
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,310
to the rear of the property.

117
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,710
And then other improvements
include the addition

118
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,220
of a bike rack and pedestrian access

119
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,110
in accordance with the
land development code

120
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,830
and staff recommends approval.

121
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,540
And this application is
also for office use only.

122
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,800
Any additional commercial
uses such as personal service

123
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,160
or other uses that require conditional use

124
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,360
in T40 will need to go

125
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,320
through a separate approval process

126
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,243
but at this time staff
recommends approval.

127
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:48,290
- Is there anyone here who would like

128
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,160
to speak on the property?

129
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,660
- It's not required if you don't want to.

130
00:06:56,576 --> 00:06:57,409
- No?

131
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,953
All right

132
00:06:58,953 --> 00:07:00,290
- So just to put on the record,
there has been no ex parte

133
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,140
communication site
visits or any conflicts.

134
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:10,863
Great, thank you.

135
00:07:12,384 --> 00:07:14,987
- And we have received no
public comment about this item.

136
00:07:14,987 --> 00:07:18,437
- And the conditions that goes with that?

137
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:21,270
- No conditions apart
from this approval is

138
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,503
for office use only.

139
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,400
- Was there a site plan
for this one included?

140
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,233
- Yes.

141
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,331
- Was the bike rack required by the city?

142
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:34,255
Or is it something that,

143
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:37,595
- Can you scroll it back
for the picture of the home?

144
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:39,000
- Bicycle parking is required,

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,090
I believe up to 10% for parking spaces.

146
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,750
So one bike rack or five bike spaces.

147
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,100
So yes, that's a requirement

148
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,277
for all commercial
development in the city.

149
00:07:49,277 --> 00:07:50,110
- Okay.

150
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:53,850
- That's the home and the access will be

151
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,170
on if you're facing the home

152
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,517
on the right side of the property.

153
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,283
And the left will be
landscaping and retention.

154
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,313
- I have a question.

155
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:09,110
So if approved, you would
be for any kind of office

156
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:11,226
or a specific one?

157
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:13,850
- So for, based on the square
footage of the property

158
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:18,850
it would likely only be
like administrative offices.

159
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:21,630
The site with the current parking

160
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,460
or with the proposed
parking would not be able

161
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,020
to support a doctor's office

162
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,690
because of the higher
parking requirements.

163
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,620
So this would just be

164
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,860
for normal office use,
administrative, something like that.

165
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,820
I believe there's a tax office

166
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,841
or accounting or something
there at the moment.

167
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:41,375
- Thank you.

168
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,208
- Okay, thank you.

169
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,708
No more questions?

170
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:48,850
- No.

171
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:52,617
Nobody has any questions.

172
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,551
- No one has any more
questions, motion to approve.

173
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:56,480
- I'll make a motion to approve then.

174
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,313
- Second?

175
00:08:57,313 --> 00:08:58,146
- Second.

176
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:00,053
- All in favor?

177
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:00,886
- Aye.

178
00:09:00,886 --> 00:09:01,719
- Any opposed?

179
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:02,700
Hearing none.

180
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,533
Motion carries.

181
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:06,420
- Who seconded that?

182
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,167
- That was simultaneous.

183
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:10,998
(laughing)

184
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:11,850
All right.

185
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,183
Public hearings?

186
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:18,248
None?

187
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:19,920
Discussion?

188
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,940
- The next scheduled meeting
I believe is July 5th.

189
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,670
However, at this time, I don't know

190
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,460
if we have any items that are scheduled.

191
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,367
We may have to postpone
or cancel that meeting

192
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,134
but I will definitely provide
you, lookout for your emails

193
00:09:39,134 --> 00:09:42,607
that we may have to postpone
that meeting on July 5th.

194
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:46,863
And meaning that the next
meeting would be the third.

195
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:50,700
So it's first and third
Wednesday of the month

196
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,140
So just keep that in mind.

197
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,870
I do know again, anytime in the summertime

198
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,670
we are aware of the different travels.

199
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,650
So just let us know ahead of time

200
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,070
that you won't be attending
so that way we just know

201
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,690
that we do have at least a quorum,

202
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,430
which is the four members.

203
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,070
And I will definitely
provide you an email.

204
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,367
But more than likely right now,

205
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:12,223
there will be no meeting on July 5th

206
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,920
and the item the next meeting
will be that Wednesday.

207
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,753
I forget.

208
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:18,586
- The 19th?

209
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:19,799
- The third, yes.

210
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,300
For that one here.

211
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,640
But I have to double check to see

212
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,160
because I don't think we've advertised,

213
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,160
but based on our schedule
I think we may have,

214
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,317
we have to speak to some
applicants regarding that meeting.

215
00:10:33,238 --> 00:10:35,223
- Okay.
- Alright, thank you.

216
00:10:35,223 --> 00:10:37,015
- It'll be a nice long Independence.

217
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:38,536
- Yes.

218
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:40,380
- Having said that, we
adhere from the chairman,

219
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,790
I just wanna make sure everyone a happy

220
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,320
and safe 4th of July.

221
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,330
Anything else from the board members?

222
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,357
- Make a motion to,

223
00:10:46,357 --> 00:10:48,607
- I have a quick comment,

224
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,563
You did a fantastic job
chairing this meeting.

225
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:52,396
- Thank you.

226
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:53,229
Thank you.

227
00:10:53,229 --> 00:10:54,420
- Very, very well done.

228
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,253
Thank you.

229
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:56,712
- Thank you.

230
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:57,545
All right.

231
00:10:57,545 --> 00:10:58,549
You were gonna motion?

232
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:00,217
- I was just gonna wait if
your head slowed down a little.

233
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:02,060
(laughing)

234
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,311
- I thought you were
gonna motion to adjourn.

235
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:04,215
- Make a motion to adjourn.

236
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:05,111
- Second.

237
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:05,944
- Second

238
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:08,331
- We are adjourned.

239
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:09,171
- Aye.

240
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:10,004
- Shall I say the time?

241
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:11,316
6:28.

242
00:11:11,316 --> 00:11:13,361
- Everybody say, "Aye."

243
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:14,281
- Everybody said "Aye."

244
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:15,114
We all said it together.

245
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:16,008
- We all seconded it.

246
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,121
(laughing)

247
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:18,954
- Cool.
