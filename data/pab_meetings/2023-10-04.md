### Agenda Item 5A: Conditional Use Request - Townhome Development on June Street

**Applicant:** Vivian Pasqua and Giovania Costa

**Project Description:**
- Conditional use request for development of townhomes within the T4R Transect zone
- Location: South side of June Street, approximately one block east of John Young Parkway, just south of Martin Luther King Boulevard
- Originally proposed as apartments/fourplex, redesigned through Development Review Committee (DRC) process to three simple townhomes

- **Number of Units:** 3 townhomes

- **Rental Restrictions:** Cannot be used as short-term rentals (no Airbnb); must be minimum one-month leases if rented

**Area Development Context:**

Brenda provided extensive context about ongoing development in the area:

1. **Property A (Subject Property):** The current application for three townhomes on June Street

2. **Property B:** June Street Apartments - approved by the board in July 2023 for conditional use

3. **Property C:** Park Place Mental Health redevelopment (approved January 2023)
   - Larger existing building will remain

   - Currently under active construction

## Public Comments

**Williemae Prettigar** (416 North Billingham, adjacent property owner) raised the following concerns:

1. **Parking:** Where will parking be located for the development?
2. **Fencing:** Will there be concrete fencing installed? She owns property adjacent to and behind the proposed development.
3. **Property Configuration:** Noted conversation with surveyor indicating three lots being combined plus a vacant lot on the side when coming off June Street.
4. **Rental vs. Ownership:** Asked whether townhomes would be rentals or owner-occupied.

**Staff Response (Brenda):**

1. **Parking:** All parking will be in individual driveways. Two units will have two-car garages, one unit will have a one-car garage. No parking lot required.

2. **Fencing:** No perimeter wall or fencing required because the property backs up to existing townhomes on King Street (same product type). Any fencing would be voluntary by individual property owners after lots are sold.

3. **Rental vs. Ownership:** Properties will be fee simple (individually owned). Can be rented but cannot be short-term rentals (must be minimum one-month leases). Not within the short-term rental overlay zone, so no Airbnb-type rentals permitted.
