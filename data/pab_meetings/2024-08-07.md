### Item 5C: Right-of-Way Vacation - McLaren Avenue

**Applicant Request:** Recommendation of approval to vacate portion of McLaren Avenue right-of-way

**Property Details:**
- Location: Between 504 Randolph (north) and separate parcel to south where Clay Street bends
- Historical: Right-of-way established by final plat September 1, 1886
- Dimensions: Approximately 63 feet wide, 122 feet long
- Current Status: Majority of McLaren Avenue (running east-west) has been developed/vacated already

**Context:**
- Does not provide vehicular or pedestrian access opportunities
- John Young Parkway bridge with steep embankment immediately to the west creates physical impediment
- Safety concerns preclude east-west connections (vehicular, pedestrian, or bicycle)

**Significant Discussion:**
Board Member Aleni raised concerns about:
- Sidewalk gaps and pedestrian safety in the area (regularly crosses there on bicycle)
- Cars traveling 50 mph in 15 mph speed bump zones on Clay Street
- Comprehensive Plan Figure 2.13 shows pixel designating additional sidewalk for 2040 on this exact plot
- Would vacation make future sidewalk completion more difficult?

**Staff Response:**
- Vacation doesn't preclude future sidewalk construction
- City has mechanisms to acquire right-of-way or easements for public benefit projects
- Form base code streetscape zone requirements allow sidewalks to meander between right-of-way and private property
- Future development would be required by land development code to provide sidewalks

**Public Comment:**
- Pat Fisher (VFW representative): VFW has been maintaining property for many years, requests right-of-way be split between two properties (north and south), willing to maintain utilities and provide access for maintenance

**Board Amendment Discussion:**
- Motion made to amend vacation to retain 15-foot strip adjacent to road for future sidewalk/multimodal use
- Amendment specifically requires property to be retained along Clay Street to accommodate future sidewalk construction

**Board Action:**
- Motion to amend: Retain 15-foot easement along Clay Street boundary for future sidewalk - **APPROVED (3-1)**
- Motion to approve with amendment - **APPROVED (3-1)**
- One board member voted against, preferring to retain full right-of-way

### Item 5D: Right-of-Way Vacation - Mill Slough Road

**Applicant Request:** Recommendation of approval to vacate portion of Mill Slough Road right-of-way

**Property Details:**
- Location: South side of Mill Slough Road, in front of 1630 and 1700 Mill Slough Road (Mill Creek Elementary School)
- Length: Approximately 1,300 linear feet
- Current Maintenance: Privately maintained by both property owners (residential and school district)
- Meandering boundary excludes existing sidewalks (sidewalks remain city property)

**Key Features:**
- Vacation does NOT include existing sidewalks
- Existing sidewalks outside perimeter fences will remain city right-of-way and city-maintained
- Vacated portions would be acquired by adjacent property owners (school and residential)
- No objections received from utility providers

**School District Clarification:**
Staff provided supplemental communication clarifying that sidewalks would remain city property and responsibility (initial confusion resolved)

**Board Member Aleni Site Visit Findings:**
- Made site visit day before meeting
- Conducted speed measurements: cars traveling 50 mph in posted 35 mph zone
- Western half: 25-foot gap with large oak trees between sidewalk and street (feels safe for children)
- Eastern half: Sidewalk adjacent to street without tree buffer (less safe for children, 4 feet from 50 mph traffic)
- Right-most segment: Missing sidewalk entirely, creating gap in pedestrian network to school
- Observed several people crossing street illegally due to lack of crosswalk (only one crosswalk mid-block)

**Comprehensive Plan Concerns:**
- Policy 2.2.4.6 (Pedestrian Bicycle Way Gap Infill): City has duty to fill missing sidewalk gaps
- Objective to preserve right-of-way for multimodal transportation improvements
- Vacation would make future improvements more difficult
- Wide right-of-way presents opportunity for enhanced bike/pedestrian infrastructure
- No clear justification for vacation (no infill development opportunity)

**Public Comment:**
- Melissa Menyel (2422 Benjamin Drive, former Mill Creek Elementary student): Would appreciate extended sidewalk and crosswalk; if city won't build it, property should go back to adjacent owners rather than remain in limbo; asked about restrictions on use if vacated
- Staff response: Would be subject to underlying zoning (RA1, RA3, or CF for school) with all setbacks and development standards

**Extensive Board Discussion:**
- Concern that vacation represents city abdicating responsibility to complete sidewalk infrastructure
- Question whether exceptionally wide right-of-way should be preserved for future multimodal improvements
- Debate over whether to approve portion where sidewalk exists versus portion with missing sidewalk
- Discussion of easement options versus full vacation

**Failed Motion:**
- Motion to approve entire vacation as presented - **FAILED (no second)**

**Amended Approach:**
After extended discussion about fence lines, property boundaries, and sidewalk gaps:
- Motion made to approve vacation ONLY for portions south of existing fence lines (areas already behind private fences)
- Retain city right-of-way for areas north of fence lines, particularly where sidewalk is missing
- Additional recommendation to city commission to:
  1. Complete missing sidewalk segment on Mill Slough Road
  2. Investigate opportunities to improve sidewalk/bicycle infrastructure to middle school
  3. Consider targeted vacation of small parcels to adjacent owners after infrastructure improvements

**Staff Clarification:**
- Typical right-of-way is 25 feet from centerline, includes sidewalk
- Motion to retain areas north of fence line would preserve city's ability to complete sidewalk
- Would require Public Works Engineering review for feasibility
- Noted stormwater inlet in area requiring consideration

**Board Action:**
- Motion to approve partial vacation (south of fence lines only) with recommendation for sidewalk completion - **APPROVED (3-1)**
- One board member opposed, preferring full vacation as originally proposed
- Recommendation forwarded to city commission to complete missing sidewalk segments on both Mill Slough Road and Randolph Avenue

## Key Themes and Discussions

### Pedestrian and Bicycle Infrastructure
Throughout the meeting, significant focus on:
- Completing missing sidewalk segments
- Safety concerns for children walking to school
- Comprehensive Plan objectives for multimodal transportation
- Preserving city right-of-way for future infrastructure improvements
- Balance between vacating unused right-of-way and maintaining ability to improve pedestrian/bicycle networks

### Right-of-Way Vacation Philosophy
Board discussed competing priorities:
- **Arguments for vacation:** Property owners already maintaining areas; prevents property from sitting unused; allows private development
- **Arguments for retention:** Comprehensive Plan duty to preserve right-of-way; enables future multimodal improvements; city responsibility for infrastructure gaps

### Procedural Clarity
Multiple discussions about:
- Roberts Rules of Order for amendments
- Board authority to modify proposals
- Distinction between amending motions versus approving with conditions
- Board's duty to evaluate consistency with Comprehensive Plan

---

## Notable Outcomes

1. **Childcare Facility:** Standard conditional use approval for repurposing former church building

2. **Warehousing Use:** Clarification of PUD zoning relationship with future land use designations

3. **McLaren Avenue:** Partial vacation with 15-foot easement retained for future sidewalk, demonstrating board's commitment to pedestrian infrastructure

4. **Mill Slough Road:** Significantly modified vacation preserving critical areas for sidewalk completion, with strong recommendation to city commission to complete infrastructure gaps

- Conducting independent research and site visits
- Raising comprehensive plan consistency questions
- Advocating for pedestrian/bicycle infrastructure preservation
- Proposing amendments to preserve city's ability to complete sidewalk networks
