## Main Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to Staff and Board
Staff presented their credentials and experience to familiarize the board with the expertise available to support their work. New board member Yolanda Bernard was welcomed to the Planning Advisory Board.

### 2. Types of Applications Before the PAB

#### **Annexations**
- **Voluntary Annexation** - Property owners requesting to join city limits from unincorporated Osceola County
- Must be contiguous to city limits (simplest criteria)
- Most complex public hearing process - requires two separate city commission meetings after PAB review
- Florida Statute 171.044 governs the process
- City also conducted mass annexation of 256 properties via interlocal agreement with county in 2019

#### **Future Land Use Amendments**
- Two types:
  - **Map Amendments** (most common) - Changing future land use designation on property
  - **Text Amendments** (rare) - Changing goals, objectives, or policies in comprehensive plan elements
- Florida Statute 163.3184 governs the process
- **Small Scale** - Less than 50 acres, expedited review, doesn't require formal state review
- **Large Scale** - Over 50 acres, requires more extensive state review
- Must transmit to Florida Department of Commerce (formerly DEO, formerly DCA) within 10 working days

#### **Rezoning**
- **Planned Unit Development (PUD)** - Customized zoning with specific development standards
- **PUD Amendments** - Changes to existing PUDs
- **Standard Rezoning** - Changing to established zoning districts in Land Development Code (LDC)

#### **Conditional Uses**
- Three types:
  1. Conditional Use (no site changes)
  2. Conditional Use with Site Plan
  3. Conditional Use with Site Improvements (in CRA districts)
- **PAB has final approval authority** for conditional uses - these do NOT go to city commission
- Board can add conditions of approval
- Uses marked "C" in use table require conditional use approval; "P" means permitted by right

### 3. Comprehensive Plan vs. Land Development Code

#### **Comprehensive Plan**
- Required by Florida's 1985 Growth Management Act
- Intended to be **aspirational and broad**, not detailed or implementing
- Looks at 10 and 20 year horizons
- Based on data from professionally accepted sources (UF population estimates, MPO, Census)
- Can reference other documents (like CRA plans) without incorporating them
- Every property in Florida has a future land use designation
- PAB serves as the **Local Planning Agency (LPA)** for Kissimmee
- Establishes density and intensity through floor area ratios
- Focuses on compatibility, adequate public services/facilities, and mitigation of adverse impacts

**Mandatory Elements:**
- Land use
- Transportation
- Intergovernmental coordination
- Parks and recreation
- Housing
- Property rights (recently made mandatory)

**Optional Elements:**
- Hazard mitigation
- Coastal (not applicable to Kissimmee)

#### **Land Development Code (LDC)**
- The **implementing document** for the comprehensive plan
- Establishes specific regulations: height, lot dimensions, setbacks, landscaping, etc.
- More detailed and regulatory in nature
- Staff recommendation: Board members should focus more on LDC than comprehensive plan for day-to-day decisions
- Changes to LDC come before PAB for recommendation before going to city commission

### 4. PAB's Role and Authority

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Acts as Local Planning Agency under Florida Statute
- Makes recommendations to city commission on:
  - Annexations
  - Future land use amendments
  - Rezonings
  - Text amendments to LDC
- **Final approval authority** for conditional uses (no commission review)
- Also serves as Brownfield Advisory Committee (rarely convenes - last meeting was for Mosaic Apartments development)

**Important Clarifications:**
- PAB recommendations don't supersede staff recommendations - both go forward to commission
- City commission has ultimate authority and can disagree with both PAB and staff
- Commission has remanded items back to DRC and PAB before
- All discussions about city business must happen in public meetings (Sunshine Law)
- Individual board members can meet with staff one-on-one for questions

### 5. Review Process Before PAB

Applications undergo extensive vetting before reaching the board:
1. **Pre-application meeting** with staff
2. **Formal application** submitted
3. **Development Review Committee (DRC)** review (sometimes multiple times) - open to public
4. Review by multiple departments: Planning, Building, Public Works, Engineering, Fire, Legal
5. **PAB review** (for applicable items)
6. **City Commission** (for applicable items - two meetings for annexations)

### 6. Staff Recommendations

**Factors Considered:**
- Comprehensive plan compatibility
- Statutory requirements
- City policies and processes
- Level of consistency
- Strategic plan priorities (set annually by commission)
- Due process for applicants
- Good faith effort to move projects forward
- Available resources and staff capacity
- Preemptions and legislative bills from state

**Recent Streamlining:**
- Outdoor storage no longer requires public hearing
- Landscape buffer waivers go to committee instead of PAB
- Many administrative processes simplified

### 7. State Preemptions

Staff discussed how state legislation increasingly limits local government authority:
- **Live Local Act** amendments - Affordable housing projects meeting criteria don't need public hearing for land use/zoning changes
- Concurrency requirements significantly weakened - developers can make improvements concurrently with development
- Cannot deny projects solely because schools are over capacity
- Capital improvement element annual updates no longer require public hearing
- Many requirements are unfunded mandates with unclear implementation guidance

### 8. Legal Training Topics (Scheduled for Early 2025)

The board agreed to schedule legal training for January/February 2025 covering:
- Quasi-judicial proceedings
- Public records
- Ethics
- Sunshine Law
- Proper procedures and boundaries

## Key Discussions and Concerns

### Comprehensive Plan Interpretation
- Extensive discussion about whether comprehensive plan should be used to add conditions to conditional use approvals
- Clarification that comp plan is aspirational, not implementing - LDC provides the implementing regulations
- Referenced documents (like CRA plans) are part of comprehensive plan for PAB consideration

### Board Effectiveness
- Board member requested advice on how PAB can be more effective
- Staff emphasized: Look at each application critically and make best recommendations
- Importance of building rapport between board and staff
- Trust in staff expertise while maintaining independent judgment
- Board has caught issues before and will continue to make meaningful recommendations

### Communication and Sunshine Law
- Extensive discussion about Sunshine Law requirements
- Board members cannot discuss city business with each other outside public meetings
- Individual meetings with staff are permitted
- "Discussion" agenda item is the legal forum for board members to discuss planning topics with each other
- Finished business that won't return can be discussed, but caution advised
- Public meetings are the "safe space" for all official discussions

### Data and Updates
- Question raised about accessing most current comprehensive plan with all amendments
- Maps are updated in GIS system and in comprehensive plan PDF
- Comprehensive plan available on new city website
- Florida Papers website has historical amendments

### Rapport and Trust
- Staff emphasized importance of building mutual trust
- Board members go through extensive vetting process before items reach PAB
- Staff recommendations reflect professional expertise, legal requirements, and policy considerations
- Board encouraged to ask questions freely in public forum
- Staff available for individual consultation

## Notable Quotes

"The comprehensive plan is the constitution, the Land Development Code is the statutes." - Kalanit Oded

**On Staff Expertise:**
"By the time these applications come to you, they've been very, very vetted... many departments... everybody looks at it before it even comes here." - Kalanit Oded

**On PAB Role:**
"At the end of the day, it is a recommendation. And as frustrating as that may be, or as extensive and as thoughtful as the process may be for each board member, at the end, it is just a recommendation, period." - Kalanit Oded

**On Building Trust:**
"Trust us, please. We are here to help our community... When I have somebody who doesn't trust me in doing my job, that creates hostility. Trust us. And we trust you." - Kalanit Oded
