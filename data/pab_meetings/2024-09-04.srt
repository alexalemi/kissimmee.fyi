1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,560
- Calling the meeting to order.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,460
Thank you all for being here.

3
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,050
Please stand for a moment of silence

4
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,500
and the pledge of allegiance.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,467
- I pledge allegiance to the flag

6
00:00:20,182 --> 00:00:22,140
and to the republic for which it stands.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,043
One nation.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,223
- Thank you.

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,910
And please silence all electronic devices.

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,973
I'm making sure mine is on silent.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,420
And if any of our board
members have any conflicts

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,540
of interest or had any
ex parte communication,

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,050
done any site research, site
visits or anything like that

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,060
regarding anything on our agenda tonight,

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,780
please let that be known,
prior to our discussions.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,740
- So I will declare I visited the site

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,440
for item 5A this afternoon.

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,060
- Okay.
- To check it out.

19
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:03,933
- Duly noted.

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,410
Thank you. Anyone else?

21
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,880
- No.
- Okay.

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,280
Minutes, we don't have
minutes from the last meeting,

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,420
I understand, correct?

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,700
Okay. Old business, nothing there.

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,283
And new business, 5A, public hearing.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,260
- Sorry, that was on automatically.

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,790
I'll be presenting this for Brenda

28
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,640
since she's out this week at a conference.

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,440
If you haven't met me yet, I'm John Raven.

30
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,080
I'm one of our new senior planners

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,020
and this is a condition use
for the site plan waiver

32
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,070
to establish an educational
service establishment,

33
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,990
Angels Touch Dental Institute,

34
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,333
a Dr., is it Menard?

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
(person speaking indistinctly)

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,040
Montero, sorry. Yes.

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,003
At her office on 715 East Vine Street.

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,720
All right, so to explain,

39
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,100
this is just a dental school
in an existing dental office

40
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,000
on the site that is going
to be offering classes

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,030
for a dental assistant program.

42
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,160
The plaza, currently where it's located,

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,800
has 101 parking spaces.

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,470
That is one parking space
for every 200 square feet

45
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,710
of commercial area for the existing uses.

46
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,680
Due to the limited number of
the parking spaces on site

47
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,157
for the existing uses,
the hours of operation

48
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:31,320
of the dental school cannot take place

49
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,070
during the same operating
hours as the dental practice.

50
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,980
In addition, the maximum
number of students

51
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,590
is going to be limited to four.

52
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,630
Staff is supporting a site plan waiver

53
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,360
since there is no work
being done to the exterior

54
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,360
of the building and
see, our recommendation

55
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,970
is to approve with conditions.

56
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,820
The conditions would be that the approval

57
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,130
of this educational service establishment

58
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,330
for the dental school in Suite C, sorry,

59
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,330
715 East Vine Street only.

60
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,340
The educational service establishment

61
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,310
use cannot be transferred or expanded

62
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,910
to other sites at 715 East Vine Street.

63
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,490
A separate conditional
use application approval

64
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,753
would be required for any such expansion.

65
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,170
The dental school has to be accessory

66
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,023
or secondary to the
existing dental office.

67
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,680
The approval of the educational
service establishment

68
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,190
does not include any public
or private school uses.

69
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,640
So it is solely limited to the classes

70
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,473
for a dental assistant program.

71
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,420
It's going to be, again,
limited to four students

72
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,040
at any given time.

73
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,520
And the hours of operation
for the dental school

74
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,583
cannot overlap with the
existing dental practice.

75
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,290
And any exterior, or sorry,
any interior alterations

76
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,200
required to add classroom or other spaces

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,420
will require a state certified contractor

78
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,080
to apply for permit and submit plans.

79
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,870
And lastly, a business
license for the dental school

80
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,263
must be issued within one
year of this approval.

81
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,570
- Thank you. Board members, any questions?

82
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,640
- Yes.
- Go ahead, Alex.

83
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,030
- I guess I was hoping for
some clarification for 0.3.

84
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,740
I don't understand what that means.

85
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,220
The approval of educational
service establishment

86
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,973
does not include any public
or private school uses?

87
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,560
- So essentially, it means that there's

88
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,148
not any other educational programs

89
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:43,260
or other courses that can take place

90
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,770
aside from that for dental assistance.

91
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,603
- Okay.

92
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,360
- Other questions from the board?

93
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,813
If not, would the applicant
like to address the board?

94
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,700
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

95
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,070
Please step to the microphone
and state your name

96
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,260
and your business address for the record.

97
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,303
- Actually, it's not a dental school.

98
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:07,770
It's a expanded duties
dental assisting school.

99
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,108
Meaning that it's-
- I'm sorry,

100
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,200
could you say your name again

101
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,220
and your business address for the record?

102
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,059
- Okay.

103
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:15,675
My name is Francisca Montero

104
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:18,420
and the business address
address is 715 Vine Street,

105
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,280
Suite 3.

106
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,620
But in the beginning I was
applying for unit seven,

107
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,890
no three, and because I
have like already a license,

108
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,877
they are already..

109
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,100
Tax received, I thought that
will expedite the process.

110
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,900
And I've been waiting
for this for three years,

111
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,250
so it's ridiculous.

112
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,540
I don't know what happened,
but I was very busy

113
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,800
and I receive email and
I didn't see the email,

114
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,800
but I'm beginning to use
my dental assisting school

115
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,590
upon the duty within my dentist's office.

116
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,073
But in the future, I want
to expand to another unit.

117
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,190
- Okay, so at this time though,

118
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,670
we're adjusting this
specific unit being used.

119
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,503
- Okay.

120
00:06:15,503 --> 00:06:17,215
- For the instruction of dental assist.

121
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:21,055
- Yes, but the clarification
is not a dental school,

122
00:06:21,055 --> 00:06:24,270
it's a dental assist on the duties.

123
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,770
- Understood.

124
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,963
Questions, board members
for the applicant?

125
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,143
Alex?

126
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,070
- So then I guess in light
of the applicant's comments-

127
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,020
- I'm sorry, who's ever
got their phone on,

128
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,730
please silence that.

129
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,983
- Oh, sorry.
- Thank you.

130
00:06:39,172 --> 00:06:41,839
(phone ringing)

131
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,720
Alex, you had a question?

132
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,580
- Yeah, so I guess I just
wanna kind of check with you.

133
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,430
Have you looked at the
conditions that the city

134
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,750
has put forward on approval
and are you kind of happy

135
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,770
with those conditions?

136
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,660
Are those adequate or you..

137
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,270
- Well, not really because you know,

138
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:17,270
I think that I can fit in my
office at least 12 students.

139
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:22,200
'Cause they work as a partner.
- Right.

140
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,690
- But, you know, I will be happy to start

141
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,283
because I have people waiting for me.

142
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,540
- Okay, thank you.

143
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,580
I guess so I have a question
for the city attorney.

144
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,650
Given that the conditions
specifically refer

145
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,700
to a dental school,

146
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,670
will that cause any difficulty
if it's meant to be used

147
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,530
as a dental assistant training program?

148
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,780
Or should we amend the conditions

149
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,180
or do you think that's fine?

150
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,000
- I think it's fine.

151
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,010
I don't think you can get accreditation

152
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,340
to have a dental school,
like for four people.

153
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,040
So I think it's understood.

154
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,740
But I mean, we could always change it

155
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,253
to say dental assistant training program.

156
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,310
- Okay.
- And also,

157
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,880
I'm a licensed dentist
in New York and I used to

158
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,710
do classes for foreign
dentist to become hygienist

159
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,030
to pass the boards.

160
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,770
And because they are limiting
to dental assisting only,

161
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,250
I think it's not fair because I can train

162
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:34,250
like in FaceTime or Zoom somebody

163
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:36,196
to become a hygienist here.

164
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,897
- Okay. So then I guess I..

165
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,800
I guess one last question.

166
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,740
How much leeway do we have as a board

167
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,080
in the sense that the city
made these recommendations

168
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,210
because they think they're necessary

169
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,640
to comply with the land development code?

170
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,040
Are we free to waive these conditions?

171
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,530
Or if those waivers are not in keeping

172
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,020
with the land development code, does that,

173
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,440
you know, how much authority do we have

174
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,183
to change the conditions?

175
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,840
- You have some discretion,

176
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,920
but the reason why, my understanding,

177
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,490
the reason why it is
limited to both the time

178
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,550
that the students can be on the premises

179
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,240
and the number of students is tied to the

180
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,490
layout and the parking.

181
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,060
So I think that it's just
an issue of capacity.

182
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,200
So we don't wanna cause, you know,

183
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,440
potential emergency or
hazardous conditions

184
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,313
within the unit or in
the surrounding units.

185
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,950
- Does anyone else have questions?

186
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,113
Comments?

187
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,993
Aaron, did you have something?

188
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,000
Go ahead, go ahead.

189
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,350
- Hello, everyone.

190
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,790
My name's Aaron Sabino,

191
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,713
and based on the statements
the young lady has made,

192
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,690
we're discussing the particular unit,

193
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,720
but she already has plans for expansion

194
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,720
and based on what this gentleman
said that she can't expand,

195
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,790
so I wanted to kind of
get an understanding of

196
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,410
if we were to pass this,

197
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,010
we're taking the notion that
she's going to fulfill it

198
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,320
and she's going to grow

199
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,470
and this is going to
cause a hazardous concern

200
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,650
and a potential matter in the future

201
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,763
for that particular plaza
right off 715 Vine Street.

202
00:10:39,797 --> 00:10:41,760
So wanna take that into consideration

203
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,733
that we're talking about 715 C today,

204
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,890
and only 715 C in the conditions in which

205
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,750
she's trying to go into.

206
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,660
I'm not sure if we're approving

207
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,290
for her to license that
particular for a dental school.

208
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,690
Is that what I'm understanding
what we're doing?

209
00:11:04,813 --> 00:11:09,292
- No, I'm licensed by
the Board of Education

210
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:14,292
and I have the permit from Tallahassee,

211
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,600
the Health Department to
teach, expanded duties,

212
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,953
dental assistant.

213
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,740
It's just that I've been
waiting for three years

214
00:11:25,107 --> 00:11:28,020
and I've been paying rent for unit seven

215
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,883
that is like in the city
will be like G, I think.

216
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,310
But I am paying like almost $5,000.

217
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:43,170
I already spent $200,000
trying to get this permit.

218
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,670
- I think some of these questions might be

219
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,140
directed to the city, could we..

220
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,679
- Yeah.

221
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,740
It's mostly directed to the city,

222
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,320
at this point, just so
I can have more clarity-

223
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,420
- Yeah, let's have a city representative

224
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,847
step to the microphone so we
can ask you some questions.

225
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:58,920
- I just need more
clarity, a little bit more.

226
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,753
- You can have a seat, ma'am,

227
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,397
and then we can have you come back up.

228
00:12:02,397 --> 00:12:05,910
- Okay. Originally I wanted-

229
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,250
- I'm sorry, everything's
gotta be on the microphone

230
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,183
and on the record.

231
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,680
What I'd like to do is
address questions to the city

232
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,360
at this time and then
we'll give you a chance

233
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,243
to respond to that, so if
you have a seat, please.

234
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,430
- Oh, okay.
- Yes, please.

235
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,480
Thank you.

236
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,530
No, that's okay. That's okay.

237
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,798
- I thought that you say
that I ask the question.

238
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:25,631
- No, no, no, no, no.

239
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:28,080
We're gonna ask the city questions.

240
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,260
Could you help us understand better why,

241
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,630
if this is my understanding,
if I'm wrong, I'm wrong,

242
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,790
let me know, that the unit seven was

243
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,400
the city declined for
her to use that for this?

244
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,083
Am I understanding that or no?

245
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,380
- I'm not specific with the, or sorry,

246
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,260
I'm not familiar with the
specifics in that situation,

247
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,420
but this doesn't preclude her from ever

248
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,070
being able to expand,

249
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,500
just that she would need
another conditional use

250
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,720
application to do so.

251
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,250
- Yeah, okay, so just
so we're clear on this,

252
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,830
tonight is for the approval or not

253
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,770
of this specific unit under the terms

254
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,450
that have been laid out.

255
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,010
- Yes, sir.
- And anything beyond that

256
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:15,300
would require a further application

257
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,810
to use another unit for
more than the four students?

258
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,000
Is that what the city is saying?

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,100
- Correct.
- Okay.

260
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,930
Board members, do you have
any questions for the city?

261
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,763
Go ahead, Alex.

262
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,500
- Yeah, so could you explain a little bit?

263
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,260
So I was trying to look at
the land development code

264
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,150
and, you know, I understand that

265
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,030
because it's in the T5 U transit zone,

266
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,250
there's certain minimum
parking requirements,

267
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,890
but this is a like shared unit.

268
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,100
And so I guess one,
could you clarify for me

269
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,160
how you allocate or decide

270
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,870
what the minimum parking requirements

271
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,430
would be for individual units?

272
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,340
And then secondly, I didn't
fully understand why the number

273
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,340
of students would be restricted to four.

274
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,573
You know, given that the
entire parcel has 101

275
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,500
parking spots currently, right?

276
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,500
As denoted in the plan or the document.

277
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,753
- Well, as the Deputy
City Attorney here said,

278
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,200
it is a matter of the capacity,

279
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,820
there are other uses that
are existing within that

280
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,200
shopping center.

281
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,560
So people, you know,
will also be coming in

282
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,293
to use those other establishments.

283
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,220
And so this is more of a
shared parking agreement

284
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,790
in the sense that you
can't have the two uses

285
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,530
overlapping at the same time

286
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,640
or else it would potentially
like shut some people out

287
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,580
of being able to find
parking either for this use

288
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,383
or for some of the other.

289
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,697
- Yeah, I guess just..

290
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,800
So I visited the site this afternoon,

291
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,530
more than half of the
parking spots were free.

292
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,050
It doesn't seem like the
parking lot is fully utilized.

293
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,823
I've never seen it full.

294
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,000
I understand that for this particular use,

295
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,700
I feel as though we have to go with

296
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,490
what the land development
code currently says.

297
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,490
But it feels like in reviewing
the land development code

298
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,770
and taking another look
at the comprehensive plan,

299
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,840
the existing minimum parking requirements,

300
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,660
especially in the
multimodal transit district

301
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,760
feel as though they're a bit oppressive

302
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,710
and might be getting in the
way of some of the other policy

303
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,910
statements in the comprehensive plan.

304
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,490
Especially ones targeting
pedestrian mixed use

305
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,140
infill development.

306
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,170
So this isn't germane to
this particular issue,

307
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,220
but maybe after this,

308
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,230
I'd be interested in
having conversation about

309
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,450
whether or not the Board
would be interested in

310
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,370
discussing or making a recommendation

311
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,670
that the commission consider revisiting

312
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,400
some of our minimum parking requirements,

313
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,960
especially in the Vine
Street CRA or the MMTD.

314
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,760
- Just to provide the Board
with a little more information.

315
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,483
The parking is based upon the
square footage of each unit.

316
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,713
- What are the other businesses
that are in that plaza?

317
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,400
- Good evening.

318
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,590
There's actually mainly retail uses,

319
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,040
which is one per 255
(indistinctly) correctly

320
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,440
and the one per 300 square feet.

321
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,514
So everything has been
established, the whole entire,

322
00:16:28,514 --> 00:16:31,350
it's the Rainbow Plaza has been,

323
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,500
it's actually in the
max capacity right now

324
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,710
with the parking
requirements which are there.

325
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,490
So the dental office requires
a bit more parking spaces

326
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,793
due to the magnitude of
clients coming in and out.

327
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,200
For the actual vocational school,

328
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,090
which is part of the land development code

329
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,600
for the parking requirements, 14-722,

330
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,170
it's one parking space
for every 3.5 students

331
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,720
and plus two spaces per three employees.

332
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,010
Hence the maximum capacity
during the daytime.

333
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:08,550
When the hours of operation
for the dental office

334
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,180
are non-operative, then
the school can utilize

335
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,960
and it cannot impact the parking demands,

336
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,770
because it is during separate hours.

337
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,770
But in retrospective,
staff takes a look into

338
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:28,350
the maximum capacity
when it's operational,

339
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,300
during the daytime and hours of operation

340
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,970
for all retail users are within the plaza.

341
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,670
So that's how the analysis is done

342
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,130
in order not to impact
additional parking spaces

343
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,310
to be utilized by the
patrons coming in and out

344
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,870
and/or employees.

345
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,110
So that's the logic behind the analysis,

346
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,143
behind the parking demands
and the parking requirements

347
00:17:49,143 --> 00:17:51,153
that are existing in the plaza.

348
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:54,999
So we cannot over park it,

349
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:57,480
meaning bringing more clientele in

350
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,670
when there's not sufficient spaces,

351
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,590
according to the land development code.

352
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,200
So that's the criteria that we utilize.

353
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,070
- Okay.

354
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,200
First of all, I wanna say I love the idea

355
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,040
that there is gonna be training going on

356
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,080
for professional positions here

357
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,100
and to help people to
get professional jobs.

358
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,873
I think that's great.

359
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,250
I'm thinking about this, I'm
just wondering about this too.

360
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:28,050
And I certainly understand
the other tenants there

361
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,540
that are leasing their
spaces have a right,

362
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,540
I'm sure per their leases,
for X number of parking spaces

363
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,970
within that based on their square footage

364
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,627
is what I'm guessing that they've got.

365
00:18:40,627 --> 00:18:42,360
"Okay, if you've got this business,

366
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,930
then you have the right to
this number of spaces there."

367
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,610
So what is allotted to this unit is that

368
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,770
number of spaces that we're saying

369
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,707
and, sorry, I'm just trying to get,

370
00:18:55,707 --> 00:18:57,480
and I'm trying to also listen

371
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,520
through the echo that goes on here.

372
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,373
I think it's a little bit
hard to hear sometimes.

373
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,913
So how many spaces are allotted
for the dental practice?

374
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,270
- The dental practice, I have
to double check on the number,

375
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,290
but if it is for dental
office, professional office

376
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,160
is one per 200 square feet.

377
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,160
So it is 20, dental office is
50, so we divide that by 200,

378
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,490
which is 10 parking spaces for that unit.

379
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,600
- Okay.
- 10.1.

380
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,850
The fraction goes over, so it's 11.

381
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,930
Plus the school, whatever
the school requires.

382
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,060
Which is-
- How many are we saying

383
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,850
for just the dental assistant training?

384
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,230
- For the vocational school,

385
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,380
it's one space for every 3.5 students,

386
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,290
plus two spaces for every three employees.

387
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,830
So that brings it up to
three parking spaces.

388
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,230
But if there's more students,

389
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,660
then you're gonna require a higher demand.

390
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,660
Hence why does the students are limited

391
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,050
or capped at a certain amount.

392
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,230
- Okay. Okay, get that, get that.

393
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,340
I'm just trying to work through
this to see, to understand.

394
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,173
Go ahead.

395
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:13,110
- One more thing to add.
- Sure.

396
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,320
- Each entire individual
tenant space, for example,

397
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,060
when we get a business tax receipt,

398
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,167
we look into the parking requirements.

399
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:22,110
If it is a professional office,

400
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,240
it's one per 200 square feet.

401
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,730
If it is a retail use, it's one per 300.

402
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,990
So the retail utilizes less parking.

403
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,710
The leases does not
allocate the parking spaces,

404
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,620
but staff looks to make sure

405
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,420
that there's adequate parking for the use.

406
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,420
So when, for example, there's
a vacant tenant space,

407
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,420
if it is within, if it was a retail before

408
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,820
and it becomes, for
example, the dental office

409
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,740
and it increments the parking demands,

410
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,830
we gotta ensure that the entire site

411
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,250
has adequate parking for those uses.

412
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,840
So for example, if that tenant space,

413
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,257
one per 200 is gonna require 30 parking,

414
00:21:07,257 --> 00:21:09,780
I'm just putting numbers,
30 parking spaces

415
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,360
and they're only allowed to have 20,

416
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,210
then we're over 10 and we
have a parking analysis

417
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,240
that we conduct in order to
approve the business licenses

418
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,040
for this particular
shopping plaza, for example.

419
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,810
And we do it throughout
the commercial sites

420
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,100
that we have throughout the city

421
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,830
to ensure there's adequate
parking for the site.

422
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,680
- Okay, so, and correct me if
I'm missing something here,

423
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,360
just so I understand.

424
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,080
Okay, so we've got four spaces
for the vocational school?

425
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,040
- Correct.
- Correct, okay.

426
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,100
And 10 for the, how many for the dental?

427
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,090
- 11 because you have
a fraction because 50.

428
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,960
- But they're not operating
at the same time, correct?

429
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,793
- That is correct.

430
00:21:49,793 --> 00:21:54,500
- So what would preclude
if this same tenant

431
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,190
is leasing both for the dentist office

432
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,800
and for the vocational school,

433
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,800
then she has a right to those
spaces for the dental school.

434
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,280
But what would preclude the
use of those spaces then?

435
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,473
Because if the dental school is not open,

436
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,273
and nobody else can use
those spaces either, correct?

437
00:22:19,614 --> 00:22:23,700
- Well the spaces cannot be

438
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,040
given to any specific person,

439
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,120
the space is for everyone
in the shopping plaza.

440
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,570
But there's hours of
operation for other tenants

441
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,730
there within the plaza, for example.

442
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,563
- Okay.

443
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,430
- If there's someone that opens at 10

444
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,320
and closes at eight or nine,

445
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,680
we cannot say these spaces
are removed from these folks

446
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,440
and they're given to the school.

447
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,580
We have to play it fair

448
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,700
and the entire parking
works for the entire plaza.

449
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,460
We can take a look into a parking analysis

450
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,730
or a parking demand, as far
as share parking agreements

451
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,480
and things of that nature,
but in this particular case,

452
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,360
and I don't have the full
details, to be honest with you,

453
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,880
I'm just giving you overall how we work,

454
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,650
as far as internally.

455
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,820
But that was how it was allocated
for this particular use.

456
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,290
- Hold on, I'm hearing,

457
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,320
does somebody else over
have comment or a question?

458
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,390
If not, Alex, do you have a question?

459
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,577
- I guess, yeah, I was just gonna..

460
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,970
To my own understanding, right,

461
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,340
this is one unit in this
kind of shared unit,

462
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,400
it's allocated about 10 spaces

463
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,560
amongst the allotment for the lot.

464
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,090
The city, part of the conditions

465
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,880
that they're putting on this thing

466
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,850
that we're trying to
approve is they're saying

467
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,350
they need to have 10 spaces,

468
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,700
a dental school needs to have one

469
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,350
for every three and a half students.

470
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,120
They're saying two things.

471
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,280
The maximum number of students
they could have is four.

472
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,020
And then they're also adding a requirement

473
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,110
that the dental school
has to operate on hours

474
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,000
that are different than
the dentist practice

475
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,890
because they're saying that these things

476
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,810
require parking spots
and there's only sort of

477
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,300
10 for this business.

478
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,310
Personally, I feel as though both,

479
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,750
well, first I have to clarify that

480
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,250
in checking the land development code,

481
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,390
I think the city's right

482
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,910
that right now the way the land
development code is written,

483
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,310
that would be the way
they would have to do it.

484
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,800
But I also wanna say that personally,

485
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,080
I feel like this is overly restrictive

486
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,810
and getting in the way
of some of the objectives

487
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,100
we have in our comprehensive plan

488
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,500
of trying to encourage infill development

489
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,233
or like vocational programs
in our Vine Street CRA.

490
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,020
My understanding is that I don't think

491
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,710
that we can really lift
those requirements ourselves,

492
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,570
'cause that's part of the
land development code.

493
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,360
But I think after we address this motion,

494
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,520
I think one thing we could do as a board,

495
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,230
if this has come to our attention,

496
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:44,340
is we could make a suggestion
that the City Commission

497
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,810
revisit some of these parking reports.

498
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:46,740
- Okay, so let's do this.

499
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,720
Let's take, 'cause there
isn't, you mentioned motion.

500
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,340
There is no motion at this point.

501
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,630
Let's address this as stated herein

502
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,329
and then we can discuss,

503
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:01,020
or the city can look at the idea of-

504
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,830
- So I will make a motion to
approve the conditional use

505
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,990
with the restrictions the city suggested.

506
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,370
- Okay, we have a motion on the floor.

507
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,203
Do we have a second?

508
00:25:09,203 --> 00:25:11,790
- Second.
- Second from Diana.

509
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,013
Any discussion? Any further discussion?

510
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,207
All in favor, please say aye.

511
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:18,110
- Aye.
- Aye.

512
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,943
- Aye.

513
00:25:18,943 --> 00:25:20,070
- Opposed, please say no.

514
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,530
Hearing none, motion carries.

515
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,363
Approved.

516
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,143
Let's go ahead and go through the,

517
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,070
can I have the agenda up again, please?

518
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,160
Okay.

519
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,120
Public hearings, okay.

520
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,340
That was our public hearing, discussion.

521
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,970
Okay, let's open the
floor up to discussion.

522
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,160
- So if I may?
- Go ahead.

523
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,993
- Okay.

524
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:49,060
So yes, so in..

525
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,310
Okay, in the land development code,

526
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,510
we've got an entire chapter

527
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,890
dealing with parking requirements

528
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,060
that sets down requirements

529
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,410
for all different kinds of business types.

530
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,420
Like the representative
from the city was saying,

531
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,860
for retail spaces, it's, you know,

532
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,340
one for every 300 square feet,
one for every 200 square feet

533
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,500
for dental practice, things like this.

534
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,170
And these parking spaces are required

535
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,240
for any sort of new development.

536
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,410
Now across the country, lots of cities

537
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,630
have discovered that these
kinds of parking requirements,

538
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:22,380
one in general, they're
like way more conservative

539
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,213
than you need to.

540
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:24,210
And I think if we drive around,

541
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,830
you can see that there's
lots of parking lots

542
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,663
that are empty.

543
00:26:26,663 --> 00:26:29,250
When I visited this site today,

544
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,960
less than half the spots were taken up.

545
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,390
And I think that's the
kind of norm everywhere.

546
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:37,080
I also think that as the
experience of our applicant today

547
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,390
highlights, things like
parking requirements

548
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,910
become a real burden for
people to actually try

549
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,403
to make things better in our
city or improve things, right?

550
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:46,290
It's one of these things

551
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,240
that people have to kind of dance around.

552
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,440
Now I think in light of this,

553
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,420
lots of municipalities across the country

554
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,910
have started to loosen

555
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,180
or a lot of times, completely
lift parking requirements

556
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,250
as part of their own
land development codes.

557
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,040
And for the most part, the
experience has all been positive.

558
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,160
This sort of allows for more development

559
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,600
and things like that.

560
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,110
In our own comprehensive plan,
I mean, it's sort of clear

561
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,810
that we have an overall objective, 1.1.5,

562
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,910
to promote innovative land use strategies

563
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,610
and urban design principles
and resource conservation.

564
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,560
And as part of that
there's specific policies,

565
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,920
including 1.1.5.8 to target density

566
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,740
and intensity proximal
to transit in our MMTD,

567
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,930
the Multimodal Transit District,

568
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,460
of which Vine Street is a part.

569
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,220
As well as policies like 1161,

570
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,830
to enable mixed use transit
oriented development pattern

571
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,680
within the multimodal
transportation district specifically

572
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,770
and policy 1162 to require
pedestrian oriented

573
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,320
site design, as well as 1163

574
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,240
to require pedestrian
oriented building design

575
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,620
within the MMTD.

576
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,990
So our comprehensive plan is telling us

577
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,550
that one of our responsibilities

578
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,700
is try to ensure that as
people try to make things

579
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,650
that we try to turn Vine Street over

580
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,120
from the kind of development

581
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,460
and car-oriented development
that it currently is

582
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,320
and try to encourage
the city and applicants

583
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,660
to kind of make things more innovative,

584
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,910
more pedestrian-friendly
and stuff like that.

585
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,210
I think the city in recognizing

586
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,060
that things like parking
requirements get in the way,

587
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,270
we specifically in
Kissimmee exempt the core,

588
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:19,230
like Broadway, the core downtown
as part of our downtown CRA

589
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,480
is exempt from parking requirements.

590
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,610
But we do not extend that exemption either

591
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,070
to the whole of the downtown CRA,

592
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,743
nor to any of the parts
of the Vine Street CRA.

593
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,110
So yeah, basically I feel
like this is one of the things

594
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,520
that kind of makes it hard for people.

595
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,230
This is one of these sort of policy things

596
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,860
that I'm not sure the
benefits outweigh the cost.

597
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,520
And I think maybe one thing
that we should consider is,

598
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,110
you know, I could imagine
sort of three levels.

599
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,430
One, we could sort of recommend

600
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,070
that maybe the City
Commission study or consider

601
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,530
lifting parking requirements
entirely in Kissimmee.

602
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,810
That's something lots of other
municipalities have done.

603
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,360
If we're uncomfortable with
that as the sort of next step,

604
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,060
I could imagine trying
to extend the exemption

605
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,860
that we already have on
the books for sort of

606
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,780
the broad street area of downtown

607
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,030
to the rest of the
Multimodal Transit District,

608
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,860
which we sort of have specific policies

609
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,900
in the comprehensive
plan trying to target.

610
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,570
Or maybe just as an
intermediate, we could try to

611
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:15,210
target some specific region
of the Vine Street CRA

612
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,310
that might be exempt from
parking requirements.

613
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,220
Or maybe one last thing
to throw out there,

614
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,350
if we still feel as though
the work the city has done

615
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,120
in these traffic studies
and stuff is useful,

616
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,160
one strategy I've seen some cities adopt

617
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,110
is they really just like
change one word, right?

618
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,670
They change it from parking requirements

619
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,200
to parking recommendations

620
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,300
and they become sort of non-binding.

621
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,180
Already in our parking chapter,

622
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,460
we have a mechanism by
which someone could appeal

623
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,130
to the City Commission and get up to 50%

624
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,960
of the parking requirements waived.

625
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,330
But another strategy I
could like, you know,

626
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,100
one thing I could imagine
doing is just saying

627
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,900
that everything is
instead of a requirement,

628
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,450
a recommendation and
you know, let that go.

629
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,400
And that would be very kind of loose

630
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,790
or I could imagine expanding
our existing, you know,

631
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:00,780
procedure for exemption
to allow up to 100%,

632
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,060
you know, basically like upon appeal to

633
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,250
either the City Commission
or with approval of the PAB,

634
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,950
we could let people be no longer subject

635
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:08,820
to the parking requirements,

636
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,430
and add that as a tool to our disposal

637
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,800
to try to consider things conditionally.

638
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,633
- Okay.

639
00:30:14,633 --> 00:30:16,557
- Can I just say one
thing really, really fast?

640
00:30:16,557 --> 00:30:19,590
And of course, you can recommend anything,

641
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,870
but just a couple of things to consider.

642
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:26,870
One is if you extinguish
all parking requirements,

643
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:31,260
no developer will ever put in parking,

644
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,600
'cause it costs them money and space.

645
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,503
That's one thing.

646
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,950
The other thing is, you
know, this matrix, right?

647
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:45,780
The 200 square foot,
300 square foot, that is

648
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:50,400
in accordance with the use
and not the specific business.

649
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,120
So you can never estimate the success

650
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,830
of the business itself.

651
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,830
You're only looking at that generic use

652
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,350
to give you that equation.

653
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,760
So, you know, I applaud what you're,

654
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,470
and I appreciate what you're saying,

655
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:11,970
but I think that definitely
in like the planner's minds,

656
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:16,080
those are pretty big considerations

657
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,460
that have them still
interested in a scheme

658
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,713
that is consistent.

659
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,130
- Other board members?
- If I may.

660
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,520
So as being a main street director

661
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,780
and working with the
main street businesses,

662
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,430
yes, there are some areas of the downtown

663
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,380
that don't have the parking restrictions,

664
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,213
but there are some that are still in

665
00:31:35,213 --> 00:31:37,230
that CRA that we represent.

666
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,750
And I've come across this
situation where we've had

667
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,801
to look at shared parking
from a church allowing parking

668
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:44,634
for a business.

669
00:31:44,634 --> 00:31:45,467
When that didn't work,

670
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:48,300
we had to ask for a special
variance to see if and prove

671
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,520
that that business doesn't
need those parkings.

672
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,530
So I've gone through this personally,

673
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,390
in my position at Main Street.

674
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,870
But one thing I want us
to be considerate of is

675
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:02,070
that we just spent 20 minutes
talking about something

676
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,560
that ultimately we
couldn't do anything about

677
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,910
today right here.

678
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,430
So I think that we had
a discussion earlier,

679
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,790
a couple meetings ago where
we talked about training

680
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,500
and we talked about the
fact that we would sit

681
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,090
and these are some of the
things that we can discuss,

682
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,350
'cause again, I agree with you,

683
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,450
in the perspective that
it needs to be reviewed.

684
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,760
I don't have the vast
knowledge of the code,

685
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,620
which I would hope to get
through that training,

686
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,290
but I can't even address some
of the things that you said,

687
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,960
because I don't have enough of
that base knowledge for that.

688
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,120
And I don't think the time and the staff,

689
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,340
you know, that's allowed here allows them

690
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,420
to be able to train us

691
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,880
and to properly let us know as you did,

692
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,650
breaking down each of those suggestions

693
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,570
as to say this won't work or this one.

694
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,130
And this is not the arena for that.

695
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,920
So I beg the question if this is something

696
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,690
that when these types of things come up,

697
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,400
if we can't table and say,

698
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,240
we already said we would
have our trainings publicly,

699
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,610
that if those aren't things
that we can do at that time

700
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,170
and be considerate of the audience

701
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,490
that we have in the time

702
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,950
and what people are actually here for

703
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,200
and what is in our capacity to do.

704
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,580
If we want to do more,

705
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,140
then we should table those discussions

706
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,160
for when we are in training

707
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,100
and have the opportunity
to have those discussions.

708
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,950
- We can, this board can never

709
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,250
change the land development code.

710
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,750
And this board also cannot
change the comprehensive plan.

711
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:22,680
Except when an amendment,
I mean an amendment,

712
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,420
you can propose an amendment.

713
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,640
A lot of times, you are
voting on amendments

714
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,770
to the comprehensive plan.

715
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,630
But those decisions,

716
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:34,410
this board is not the final voice.

717
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:37,140
Those are all recommendations
that go to City Commission.

718
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,460
So-
- Understood, yeah.

719
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,198
- The fast and quick is that, you know,

720
00:33:42,198 --> 00:33:45,423
that is the limitation to your authority,

721
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:51,270
in terms of what we would
consider a legislative review.

722
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,110
- Right.

723
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:55,410
- So you are really
confined to a certain extent

724
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,600
when an application comes before you

725
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,600
to what our current code and
comprehensive plan allows for.

726
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:04,523
- And I think-

727
00:34:04,523 --> 00:34:06,120
- I'm sorry Alex, Robert's rules.

728
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,390
Anybody else have anything
to say regarding this?

729
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,263
- Yeah, I do.

730
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,830
So when you present something to us,

731
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:17,430
we're supposed to evaluate it, look at it,

732
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,800
and if we see something
that might be of question,

733
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,710
bring it to your attention
and let it go at that

734
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,343
and vote on it, yes or no?

735
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:29,550
- You know, you're supposed
to come in, you know,

736
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,320
staff gives you their recommendation.

737
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,900
They're giving you all
the information, you know,

738
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,810
what the basis, what
their analysis is based on

739
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:39,180
what their conclusions are based on,

740
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:42,150
and the different code
or comp plan provisions

741
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,623
that they're relying on.

742
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,100
You're supposed to look at that

743
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,270
and see if that is consistent
with those original documents,

744
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,090
the comp plan and the
land development code.

745
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,640
- So we're not the
developer or the planner

746
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,920
or the instigator or anything.

747
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,040
We just see what's there and evaluate it.

748
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,040
- That is your primary, but
you also are charged with

749
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:11,670
making recommendations, you
know, in a broader scale

750
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,120
having to do with the comprehensive plan,

751
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,863
but not the land development code.

752
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:22,620
- So to Diana's point, I understand that,

753
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,200
you know, I probably should
have narrowed that down

754
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,440
or filtered that to the
specific agenda item

755
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,940
and then let's vote on that

756
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,703
and then have this discussion
as we're doing right now.

757
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,990
I always like to try to let
everybody speak their piece

758
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,730
so that, you know, I'm
not cutting anybody off,

759
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,830
everybody gets to to speak,

760
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,760
but with regard to this
in a general sense,

761
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,130
I'm just, I have questions.

762
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:47,963
Go ahead.

763
00:35:47,963 --> 00:35:50,520
Sorry, did you wanna throw something in?

764
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,930
Go ahead. Go ahead.

765
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,213
Please.
(person speaking indistinctly)

766
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,463
- No, it's Doug.

767
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,043
- For those that don't know
me, I'm Douglas Ethridge,

768
00:36:01,043 --> 00:36:03,303
I'm the Assistant Director
of the department.

769
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,350
It's a valid, valid issue,

770
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:10,170
and frankly, it's already on
the docket to be reviewed.

771
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,660
We already have consultants
lined up to do these things

772
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,020
and to go with Commissioner, or excuse me,

773
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,340
Member Diana's suggestion,

774
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,520
it would be advantageous
for us to get together

775
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,050
and train and talk.

776
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:28,110
Then we can talk to you on what things

777
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:31,530
were already on the docket,
already being reviewed

778
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,480
and brought back before City Commission,

779
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,830
because the parking study
is just not a simple factor

780
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,120
that we can do overnight.

781
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,390
That will probably take
years to actually do,

782
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:45,150
because there's just so
many facets that go into it.

783
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,600
It's just not one use and
applies across the board or such.

784
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,240
We have to look at every aspect
of things that consistency,

785
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,060
the fairness, all those
things that goes into it.

786
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:58,650
So I just wanted to mention
that we already have that,

787
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,170
it's already been directed
by commission to do that.

788
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:05,426
It's just identifying the
priority orders of the things

789
00:37:05,426 --> 00:37:07,080
that they've already given us to do.

790
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,590
And that will be coming
to you in the future.

791
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,050
- And having the staff numbers
to be able to accomplish

792
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,160
everything that you're tasked at doing.

793
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,410
- Correct, because it's just not planning

794
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,520
that goes into this.

795
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,002
It's fire, access liens.
- Sure.

796
00:37:20,002 --> 00:37:22,200
- It's handicap
accessibility with the state.

797
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,610
There is a variety of different things

798
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,630
that we have to look at to go through.

799
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,640
- Yeah, I'm sure there's a
lot more than meets the eye

800
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,330
and we are not going to
have the working day-to-day

801
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,997
expertise that you and
your staff have on this.

802
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:35,160
But we're asking the questions,

803
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,910
and I'm gonna say this, I'm just thinking,

804
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:42,750
in general here, if you've
got, like Diana was saying,

805
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,260
I think if I heard her
right about the shared usage

806
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,700
of the spaces, if you've
got X number of spaces

807
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,640
and you've got a tenant
who is going to have

808
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,930
two different units in a development

809
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,930
and that person has a
right to 10 spaces here

810
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,710
and four spaces here,
isn't that to some extent

811
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:12,710
fungible for that tenant
in that they would,

812
00:38:14,107 --> 00:38:18,480
"Okay, during the evening,
the 10 spaces that I have

813
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,260
because of my dental
operation are not being used.

814
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,750
But there are still those 10 spaces

815
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,240
that are allocated for my practice

816
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,610
that can't be used for
something else after,"

817
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,870
unless I'm wrong about that.

818
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,750
Like at eight o'clock at
night, they can't use that.

819
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,550
Somebody else next door can't use it,

820
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,650
'cause that's 10 spaces
for the dental practice.

821
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,050
So does that mean in the
evening they sit empty?

822
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,240
And could that not again, be fungible

823
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,240
towards another unit that
that same tenant may have?

824
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,860
That's just what's going through my mind.

825
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,218
There's probably a lot more
to it than meets the eye.

826
00:38:52,218 --> 00:38:53,051
- There is.

827
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:55,290
There's a lot of factors
and this one being

828
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:59,640
a little bit more detailed than most,

829
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,610
because most instances
it's a single business

830
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:05,520
and a one unit structure.

831
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,650
That's simple, quick and easy.

832
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,170
If it's a shopping center type of field

833
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:13,290
and a larger than 25,000
square foot building,

834
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:18,290
it combines all the uses into
a larger parking requirement.

835
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,990
But when you don't exceed that 25,000,

836
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,910
it requires every single tenant

837
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,120
to have its own parking requirement.

838
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,320
So in this particular
instance, it's not happening,

839
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,370
but you have to plan, you
have to potentially plan for

840
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:38,340
every single one of those
units in that building

841
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,050
to be at the highest intensity use.

842
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,340
Which could be a restaurant.

843
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,380
That's one for 80 parking spaces,

844
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,260
or excuse me, one parking
space for every 80 square feet.

845
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,910
So if you have five tenants
that have one parking,

846
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,820
excuse me, one for every 80 square feet,

847
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,370
it's gonna fill up that
parking lot, plus more.

848
00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:00,690
Plus, we don't control the
hours of business activity.

849
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,810
So they can be open 24 hours or however,

850
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:04,890
we don't control that.

851
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:08,384
Nor do we control the aspect of what

852
00:40:08,384 --> 00:40:12,030
a landlord allows for its tenants.

853
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,370
We just say this is the maximum of parking

854
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:18,450
that you have to have for
that business activity.

855
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,890
However you distributed that

856
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,690
amongst your tenants is up to you.

857
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,777
So there's a lot of factors
that play into those things.

858
00:40:24,777 --> 00:40:26,160
- All right, Alex, go ahead.

859
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,970
- And so I can understand
what the city is saying

860
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,340
and I fully respect the
fact that the city has

861
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,590
a level of expertise and
experience with these things

862
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,423
that we lack.

863
00:40:36,585 --> 00:40:38,730
At the same time, the duty of this board,

864
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,690
the reason we exist at all,

865
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:42,570
the reason we're a City
Advisory Board I think is,

866
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,560
you know, as the city said,

867
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,850
they've got a lot to worry about.

868
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,890
They've got a lot of things
that they need to consider.

869
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:49,260
All different kinds of
aspects of planning and zoning

870
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,330
and legal and things.

871
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,970
What we're tasked with,
and the reason we exist

872
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,010
is because we're tasked with sort of

873
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:58,410
looking at the comprehensive plan,

874
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,700
maintaining a comprehensive plan,

875
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,150
suggesting amendments to
it, and try to ensure that

876
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,670
the evolution of the city
and the things going on

877
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,640
and the things reflecting
the land development code

878
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,560
are sort of in keeping with the vision

879
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,270
laid out in that document.

880
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,550
You know, the city has
a lot to worry about.

881
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,050
We're supposed to worry about one thing.

882
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,850
We're supposed to worry
about the comp plan.

883
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,950
And I guess what I'm trying to say is,

884
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,230
I also understand that these
things are under review.

885
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,660
I think the city
acknowledges that some of its

886
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,240
parking restrictions
might be too oppressive.

887
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,440
And part of what the new
consultants are looking at,

888
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,240
I think, are changes like this.

889
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,790
But I think our role, one
of our roles, could be

890
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:38,236
that looking at the existing comp plan

891
00:41:38,236 --> 00:41:41,340
and some of the objectives
the city has to try to,

892
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:45,030
you know, improve development
and try innovative uses

893
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,850
in the Vine Street
code, we could, I think,

894
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,220
add to the discussion,
show a bit of support

895
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,990
and highlight and make a recommendation.

896
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,823
That's all we're doing.

897
00:41:52,823 --> 00:41:55,530
All we can do is say that we,
you know, believe something.

898
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:57,240
We don't actually have
any power or authority

899
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,400
over the land development
code, as the attorney said.

900
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,950
But one thing we could as
a body is we could voice

901
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:05,940
that like, "Yeah, we believe that maybe

902
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,370
the current parking requirements
are getting in the way

903
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:13,370
of Kissimmee vision to
try to really transform

904
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,730
the multimodal transit, the
MMTD, the Vine street CRA,

905
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,050
the downtown CRA.

906
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:21,120
And that's a thing we could
say and we could say as a body

907
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,890
and it's just a statement we could make.

908
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,640
And I feel like it's one we should.

909
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:28,197
- And no disrespect, but I
think you've already said that

910
00:42:28,197 --> 00:42:30,540
and that could be on record to prove that

911
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,340
that's part of your saying.

912
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,990
I don't think there has
to be a separate motion,

913
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:36,783
because it's already been
directed to staff to do so.

914
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,780
- Yeah, I don't think we're
making any motions here.

915
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,510
We're just having part of the discussion.

916
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:45,273
So anything else? Anyone else?

917
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,220
- As he alluded to, I just wanted to make

918
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:54,480
everyone understand that
this is enhancing downtown,

919
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,760
'cause there's stuff
that's not being utilized

920
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,920
and she's bringing in a good business

921
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,850
that's going to bring
in professional jobs,

922
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:06,090
that's going to also be a part of the city

923
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:09,150
that could use their
tax dollars to our city

924
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,190
to enhance it in other ways,

925
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:13,680
as far as maybe shopping downtown,

926
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,050
eating downtown for lunch.

927
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:21,050
I think that we really need to take more,

928
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,420
approach of kind of seeing
what they're offering

929
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,040
instead of trying to get into the weeds

930
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,890
and trying to be the engineers. (laughs)

931
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:31,360
More so just be the advisory
of making sure that,

932
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,310
like, as he stated, does it affect

933
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,710
the comprehensive city plans of

934
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,603
what we have over the 50 years.

935
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:46,740
State me if I'm wrong,
but that's what I see that

936
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,650
what she's offering right now
for that space on that city

937
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,550
where that strip is, that
could be a really good space

938
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,010
of use for the short term that she has

939
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,930
until she grows into something bigger.

940
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:01,120
I would just more, my
questioning was more aligned with

941
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:06,780
him stating that this unit
can only has a limited amount

942
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,990
of space inside of this she can use for,

943
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:14,190
but it's kind of, she's
already, in my mind,

944
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,023
is already thinking

945
00:44:15,023 --> 00:44:17,760
that it's already bigger
than what she has planned.

946
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,040
And she's probably already thinking about

947
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,710
the expansion part of it.

948
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:26,613
Is that taken into question with the city?

949
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:29,610
'Cause I can't make that
decision and determination.

950
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:32,400
I just wanna go for what
she's advocating for,

951
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,400
for conditional use with
the site plan waiver.

952
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,450
So that waiver itself
is what we're discussing

953
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:41,910
and advising say, "Hey, please.

954
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:44,220
Thank you guys for giving
me the information.

955
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,980
You know, I think a motion to approve this

956
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,160
for this particular
waiver for this school."

957
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,450
- Well, and that was done.

958
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:52,854
That was done.
- Right, right.

959
00:44:52,854 --> 00:44:54,540
I'm just making sure that that's clear.

960
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,100
- No, with this, we're just,

961
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,700
this is just general discussion
about parking overall,

962
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,080
how it fits in with comprehensive plan.

963
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,270
- But I think to agree
with what you're saying

964
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,773
and kind of lean in, right?

965
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:10,350
I like the story that came before us.

966
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:13,110
I felt as though they
were being overly hampered

967
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,940
in the parking requirements,

968
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,950
but I felt like my hands were tied.

969
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:20,250
I felt like this was a
thing that wasn't keeping

970
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,200
with the comp plan, but we are bound by

971
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,250
the land development code

972
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,920
and it felt like our land
development code was overly rigid.

973
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,900
It didn't allow us any leeway.

974
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,800
It doesn't allow the the
applicant any leeway.

975
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,420
There were no sort of release valves.

976
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,420
And that just feels like,
yeah, the part of the issue

977
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:41,043
is overly restrictive requirements.

978
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:43,230
- Okay.

979
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:45,300
Yeah, I'll allow you say a few words

980
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,703
and then we're gonna move forward.

981
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,080
- Okay. Sorry about..

982
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,133
I'd like to say that I have,

983
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:58,893
I allow by the landlord
to use like 14 spaces.

984
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:04,170
But at night when I go to operate

985
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:09,170
the dental assisting
school is like 60 or more

986
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,480
parking spaces available every day.

987
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,880
Is a pharmacy there that they don't have

988
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,010
any client coming in.

989
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:21,690
They deliver the
medication to the patients.

990
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:26,690
Is a carpet store that they
don't have any clients coming in

991
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:36,410
but my point is that
with those limitation,

992
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,500
I don't have any room to roll.

993
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,333
- Okay.

994
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:42,166
And I'm gonna just have to say

995
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,740
that's something you'll have to take up in

996
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,930
whatever application process with the city

997
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,540
and move forward with that.

998
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,410
But I am going to move
to the next portion here,

999
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:55,740
Chairman and board members,
of this, but thank you.

1000
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,200
We've approved what we had before us

1001
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,720
and I encourage you to
discuss with the city

1002
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,911
any further application at that point.

1003
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,930
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1004
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:07,800
- And also I'd like to ask
what the gentleman said

1005
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,287
about the getting the city more quality

1006
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,100
in the environment in
particular in that building

1007
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,220
is a lot of homeless people
that goes there at night.

1008
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,840
- Yes, I understand.

1009
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,880
Ma'am, I'm sorry, we're gonna
move forward with the agenda.

1010
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,860
- Okay, no problem.
- Thank you.

1011
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,780
And I think we are pleased to hear

1012
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,730
that the city is going to move forward

1013
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:32,400
with studying the parking
issue and I think we all have

1014
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,530
questions about that and
think it can be used more,

1015
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:36,750
but we did approve your-
- Okay, thank you.

1016
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,000
- Application. Thank you.

1017
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:41,040
Hearing Chairman and board members,

1018
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,690
I'm just gonna say again, encourage.

1019
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:44,790
Yeah, let's look at that
and see what makes sense.

1020
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:47,460
Because if somebody's got 14 spaces

1021
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,650
and she's allowed, just
like Doug had said,

1022
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:53,070
not that we can't, we
don't dictate the hours

1023
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,050
that they can be used,
whether it's midnight,

1024
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:56,613
11, 2:00 AM whatever,

1025
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,810
that if she can use those at any time,

1026
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:01,643
then if it's the same,

1027
00:48:01,643 --> 00:48:03,840
it's not like she's gonna
be in conflict with herself

1028
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,300
between the 10 or 11
for the dental school,

1029
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,770
the dentist practice,

1030
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:10,260
and then the four for the,
she's not gonna sue herself

1031
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,110
over that as opposed to a
different entity altogether.

1032
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:16,500
So to me it would make
sense to be able to, again,

1033
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,980
I use the word fungible for
if that person is allotted

1034
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,890
