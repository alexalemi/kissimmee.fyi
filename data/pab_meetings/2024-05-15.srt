1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,940
- Let me know if you guys are ready?

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,392
Okay, calling the meeting
to order at six o'clock.

3
00:00:06,392 --> 00:00:07,701
Please stand for a moment of silence

4
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:09,784
and Pledge of Allegiance.

5
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:18,709
- I pledge allegiance to the Flag

6
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:20,439
of the United States of America,

7
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:22,668
and to the Republic for which it stands,

8
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:25,269
one nation, under God, indivisible,

9
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:28,128
with liberty and justice for all.

10
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,128
- Thank you.

11
00:00:29,976 --> 00:00:33,158
Please silence all electronic devices.

12
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,818
Let me make sure mine is.

13
00:00:34,818 --> 00:00:39,318
And if any board members
have had any sort of outside,

14
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:43,229
done any outside research
about any of our agenda items,

15
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:45,006
or have any conflicts of interest,

16
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:49,307
or had ex-parte communications
with any of the parties,

17
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:51,806
please make that known.

18
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:56,029
And let's take a look at
the March 20th minutes.

19
00:00:56,029 --> 00:01:00,200
Do we have any motions
regarding those minutes?

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,317
- I make a motion to approve.

21
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:04,299
- We have a motion to
approve from Robert Spalding.

22
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:06,929
- Second.
- Second from Melissa Thacker.

23
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:09,358
Any changes or discussion, any discussion?

24
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:11,436
If not, oh yeah, Alex, go ahead.

25
00:01:11,436 --> 00:01:15,079
- Sorry, I was just checking
Greg's email last week,

26
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,148
and I was double-checking Robert's Rules

27
00:01:17,148 --> 00:01:18,277
and I think you were right.

28
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:20,878
You said that according to Robert's Rules

29
00:01:20,878 --> 00:01:23,789
the minutes generally do consist of just

30
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:26,366
the business that was done
in the meetings, and less-

31
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:29,591
- My understanding is what
is done, not what is said,

32
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:31,350
is my understanding.
- Yes.

33
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,109
I mean, but these minutes also include

34
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:35,058
some of our commentary, I mean,

35
00:01:35,058 --> 00:01:37,707
I think it does seem
like there's a precedent

36
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:40,406
to have sort of an
overview of the discussion,

37
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:45,406
but I think if you wanted
to, you could (indistinct).

38
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:50,831
How do we feel about that?

39
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:52,793
- As far as these having

40
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:55,458
what was said by individuals on here?

41
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:56,448
Is that-
- Yeah.

42
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:59,698
- Okay, is that, are you asking that...

43
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:05,021
Kalanit, what is your take on it?

44
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:09,352
- So, minutes, just the
requirements by statute,

45
00:02:09,352 --> 00:02:11,143
is that minutes must be taken,

46
00:02:11,143 --> 00:02:16,143
there's no specificity of
what those minutes need to be.

47
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:19,363
Typically, we like to have
them just action-based,

48
00:02:19,363 --> 00:02:22,410
so not too much back and forth dialogue.

49
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,012
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't think it hurts,

50
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:30,322
but, you know, what
part, I don't know, Alex,

51
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:33,710
where you're coming from
with this, but, you know-

52
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,811
- Alex, are you talking
about like where it says,

53
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:40,412
'Planning Member, Ryan, stated that,'

54
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:43,143
those things there?
- Yeah.

55
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:46,046
You know, and again, I guess I just

56
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:47,778
tried to do some homework.
- Yeah.

57
00:02:47,778 --> 00:02:50,429
- Our Board is governed by Robert's Rules,

58
00:02:50,429 --> 00:02:52,846
the Rules, Section 48-2 says,

59
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:56,556
'In minutes you retain
what is done in meetings,

60
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:57,474
'not what is said.'

61
00:02:57,474 --> 00:02:59,070
- That's always been my understanding.

62
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,287
Are you asking that these
be amended to delete the-

63
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:05,915
- I think staff would
very much be in favor

64
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:08,126
of just having just very condensed-

65
00:03:08,126 --> 00:03:09,188
- Makes her job easier.

66
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,188
- Action-based minutes, moving forward.

67
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:14,189
- Yeah, but I also wanna
point out that the city,

68
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:15,022
it's Robert's Rules,

69
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:18,598
but the city also has policies
by the Clerk's Office.

70
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,089
We've streamlined a lot of it

71
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:22,228
because before it was verbatim,

72
00:03:22,228 --> 00:03:24,864
and so the changes that we have,

73
00:03:24,864 --> 00:03:27,544
that we had training from
the City Clerk's Office

74
00:03:27,544 --> 00:03:28,974
to stream line a lot of that.

75
00:03:28,974 --> 00:03:30,511
So that maybe could be something

76
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:33,044
that we could take up
with the Clerk's Office,

77
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:35,340
but I know they have their own guidelines.

78
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,171
- I agree, less is best,
and just put on the record,

79
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:43,171
regardless of what's in our minutes,

80
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:46,191
it is not verbatim.

81
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:49,125
It's nothing that's
particularly actionable,

82
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:53,383
if somebody was to contest
any decision of the Board

83
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:57,716
they would have to have had
a court reporter present

84
00:03:58,846 --> 00:04:02,754
and use that as their basis for appeal.

85
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:07,421
So it doesn't incriminate us,
if that's a concern, Alex.

86
00:04:08,322 --> 00:04:10,923
But yes, I think we can probably,

87
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:15,756
moving forward we can just
have an action-based and not...

88
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:22,384
- Yeah, so I guess I will (indistinct),

89
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:23,756
I'll make a motion to amend-

90
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:28,756
- Well there's a motion on the
floor already to approve it.

91
00:04:28,898 --> 00:04:32,296
- Amendments get precedent
over (indistinct), right?

92
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:33,129
- Can anybody-

93
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:36,447
- Motion to amend the-
- Second, okay.

94
00:04:36,447 --> 00:04:39,428
Okay, so you are motioning what?

95
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:42,058
- So I will make a motion
to amend the minutes

96
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:46,109
and to strike the subsequent paragraphs

97
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:49,091
starting with 'Board member Lenny asked'

98
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:52,118
then, as well as 'planning
member Ryan stated'

99
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:53,822
followed by 'Board member Lenny asked'

100
00:04:53,822 --> 00:04:57,322
followed by 'planning member Ryan stated'.

101
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,699
And it's-
- Ending where?

102
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:05,769
- Those paragraphs.
- Okay, just those, okay.

103
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:10,436
Okay, then do we have a second
for that motion to amend?

104
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,867
- Yeah, I'll second that.

105
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,658
- Okay, we have a second.

106
00:05:17,658 --> 00:05:19,575
Any further discussion?

107
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:25,381
If not, all in favor as
amended, please say aye.

108
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:26,342
- Aye.

109
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:27,837
- Opposed, please say no.

110
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:30,754
Hearing none, minutes are approved.

111
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:34,802
I don't disagree with-

112
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,188
- I'm sorry you said
the minutes are approved

113
00:05:37,188 --> 00:05:38,491
subject to the amendments,

114
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:42,250
so that means that you're
wanting to bring it back?

115
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,083
Or approving it as is?

116
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:46,737
- Approved with the strikeouts.

117
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:48,186
- The strikeouts, strike through?

118
00:05:48,186 --> 00:05:50,146
- Yeah, so it doesn't need
to come back, correct?

119
00:05:50,146 --> 00:05:52,609
It was approved with the removal,

120
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:53,995
with the redaction of that.

121
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:56,415
So I, yeah, I don't object to it

122
00:05:56,415 --> 00:05:58,335
'cause it's simpler for everybody

123
00:05:58,335 --> 00:05:59,767
and that was always my understanding

124
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:02,277
is what's done and not what is said.

125
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:04,747
- And so I think that what I'm gathering

126
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:08,529
is the consensus of the
Board is, moving forward,

127
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:09,917
we should just have an action-based-

128
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:13,286
- That is my opinion, I'm just one voice.

129
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:17,953
- Well why don't we, why
doesn't somebody make a motion?

130
00:06:19,237 --> 00:06:22,684
- Well, so I'm not sure we need to.

131
00:06:22,684 --> 00:06:24,549
My impression is we wouldn't
need to move on that

132
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:27,788
if that's already sort of the
governing rules for the body.

133
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:30,005
- Apparently it is not, so.

134
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:33,216
- But I think, is it just
a function at this point

135
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:35,549
of perhaps not understanding

136
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:39,241
what should be included in the minutes

137
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:41,574
of whomever wrote this?
- No.

138
00:06:42,556 --> 00:06:45,329
- No?
- Respectfully, no, no.

139
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:48,009
It was, again, it was
part of cross training

140
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:50,549
from the City Clerk's
Office across the Board

141
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:51,786
for Advisory Boards.

142
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,607
So there's some consistency
in certain types of detail

143
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:55,498
and information.

144
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,626
I understand with Robert's Rules,

145
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,147
but because especially in the case of

146
00:07:00,147 --> 00:07:03,239
if this particular amendment moves forward

147
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:06,012
to City Commission, they
would like to know perhaps

148
00:07:06,012 --> 00:07:07,651
sometimes part of the discussion

149
00:07:07,651 --> 00:07:10,173
if there was some type
of issue that came up,

150
00:07:10,173 --> 00:07:13,541
the reasoning and justification behind it.

151
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,533
So this is why this has
been a long standing,

152
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:20,032
where a bit more information is included

153
00:07:20,032 --> 00:07:23,244
on some of these types of amendments,

154
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:25,094
zoning map amendments, what have you.

155
00:07:25,094 --> 00:07:27,433
It provides a little bit more
clarity and justification

156
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:29,762
as to there was some
concerns about traffic,

157
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:32,333
there was some concerns about
certain types of things,

158
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,844
and they understand and,
looking at the minutes,

159
00:07:35,844 --> 00:07:38,472
they understand that these
were particular issues

160
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:40,962
during the Planning Advisory Board.

161
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:41,795
- Okay.

162
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:47,799
I guess, is there a workaround
where the Commission

163
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:51,882
can get what they need,
but still be adherent to-

164
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:56,710
- Again, we've streamlined,
it used to be verbatim,

165
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,940
that this was training that
our staff has gone through

166
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,560
with our City Clerk's Office,

167
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,643
as to how minutes are
presented, are streamlined.

168
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:10,465
- What's the city's legal
opinion on this discussion?

169
00:08:10,465 --> 00:08:15,465
- I mean, policy is one thing
and practice is another thing.

170
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:20,955
The law does not specify what
needs to be in the minutes.

171
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:23,788
Nothing, I mean, again, as I said,

172
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:28,194
if anybody was to challenge a decision

173
00:08:28,194 --> 00:08:31,993
that's something where the
minutes would scarcely help them.

174
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:35,942
They would have to have
a court reporter here,

175
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:38,593
having a verbatim transcript,

176
00:08:38,593 --> 00:08:41,372
not our audio recording.

177
00:08:41,372 --> 00:08:44,793
But I do believe we have
audio recording back up.

178
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:49,043
- Okay, let me ask this,
read verbatim for us Alex,

179
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,468
what it says regarding-

180
00:08:52,468 --> 00:08:54,523
- Yeah, so Robert, so
my first understanding

181
00:08:54,523 --> 00:08:56,822
is reading the City code
it very clearly says

182
00:08:56,822 --> 00:08:58,160
that the Planning Advisory Board

183
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,541
is governed by Robert's Rules.

184
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:03,397
- Okay, but what does that
specifically state, verbatim?

185
00:09:03,397 --> 00:09:05,377
- 48.2 says 'Content of minutes,

186
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:07,597
'in an ordinary society,
the minutes should contain

187
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:09,434
'a record of what was done at the meeting,

188
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:10,267
'not specific-

189
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:13,132
- Okay, so in a legal sense
it says should, not shall,

190
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:14,833
there's a difference there.

191
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,666
- Right.

192
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,372
- So should does not dictate

193
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:19,654
that there shall not be, correct?

194
00:09:19,654 --> 00:09:22,922
- Right, I mean, basically the requirement

195
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:27,482
is that you have to have the
action taken by the Board.

196
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:31,681
- So it doesn't, it's not stating
in Robert's Rules of Order

197
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:34,703
that it must not include that.

198
00:09:34,703 --> 00:09:35,791
- Correct.

199
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,917
- It is just saying should,
which is the legal difference

200
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:39,516
between should and shall.

201
00:09:39,516 --> 00:09:40,349
- Right.

202
00:09:40,349 --> 00:09:42,531
- That and the fact that
these meetings are recorded,

203
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:43,630
audio recorded-
- Yes.

204
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,118
- So everything, verbatim, is available.

205
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,649
I think the only thing that
shortening the minutes would do

206
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:52,710
is take ease on the person taking minutes.

207
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,543
- Yes.

208
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:55,711
- But if there's no
harm to having it, then-

209
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,544
- There is-

210
00:09:56,544 --> 00:09:59,670
- If it's helpful for City Commission.

211
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,120
- Provided that they're, you
know, accurate depictions,

212
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,703
which is what staff aims to do.

213
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,050
- And that's why we check
the minutes before moving on.

214
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:08,883
- Right.

215
00:10:08,883 --> 00:10:10,630
I mean mostly to make
sure that there aren't

216
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,181
misrepresentations, that
the vote is correct,

217
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:20,181
the outcome is correct, and
that any, you know, opposition.

218
00:10:20,478 --> 00:10:24,370
I think a big portion is not really to

219
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,287
capture everybody's back and forth,

220
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:32,506
but really to get the
public's input on the record.

221
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,169
- Mm-hmm.

222
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:37,252
So, if we were to do any sort of vote

223
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:39,716
that's not already on the agenda,

224
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:41,808
would that need to be pushed forward

225
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:46,519
to another meeting where
that item would be published?

226
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,811
Three days in advance?

227
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:52,199
- I mean, not if it's
something that's house keeping,

228
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:54,048
which this would be.

229
00:10:54,048 --> 00:10:57,131
Again, as I said, if I'm an applicant

230
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,278
and my application gets denied,

231
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,028
I'm not looking to the
minutes for my appeal.

232
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:09,277
- I'm ambivalent about
whether it's on there or not,

233
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:12,255
but I believe that it
should always be accurate,

234
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,565
and when it states that,

235
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:16,124
because these are not specific quotes,

236
00:11:16,124 --> 00:11:18,496
we don't have a court reporter,

237
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:21,913
it really is more of a guideline I guess,

238
00:11:22,826 --> 00:11:24,283
like you're saying, to
the City Commission.

239
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,946
I'm pretty ambivalent about this.

240
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:28,426
But, again, my understanding
always was that it's,

241
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:32,336
the minutes should be what
is done, not what is said,

242
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:36,676
but again, reading that,
verbatim, the should versus shall,

243
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:41,343
to me there's a leeway as to
whether we should or shall.

244
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:43,320
- Correct.

245
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:45,987
- Sorry, Robert, go ahead.

246
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:49,105
- I'm thinking out loud, okay.

247
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:50,645
- Speak out loud, and be heard.

248
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:53,227
- We went through this
with Tom, do you remember?

249
00:11:53,227 --> 00:11:56,335
Between Robert's Rules and
how the City does things

250
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:59,827
compared to how we see it on the agenda?

251
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:02,004
It was more better for
you guys to do the work-

252
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:04,174
- Would you activate your mic?

253
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:06,756
- It was better for the City
to go ahead and do the work

254
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:09,616
and give us a short term agenda

255
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:11,734
so we didn't have to
follow everything by line

256
00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:15,754
or by the rules, you
guys already did that.

257
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:17,293
The City did that.

258
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:20,413
We didn't have to do that
because it was already done.

259
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:22,491
And we took it at the generality of it

260
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,658
rather than the specifics.

261
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:27,610
We did that with Tom.

262
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,777
- Okay, so I think for now we can just

263
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,371
leave things as they are?

264
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:36,293
- Well, unless Alex is making a motion,

265
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:37,753
unless someone is making a motion.

266
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:40,983
- Well, I guess I just, again I'm also,

267
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:43,566
like I personally don't really,

268
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,052
I definitely, this feels
like a happy medium

269
00:12:47,052 --> 00:12:49,925
compared to a couple weeks
ago or whatever it was-

270
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:51,927
(indistinct)
- Yeah.

271
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:54,324
- That's what sparked me
to try to dig into it,

272
00:12:54,324 --> 00:12:57,006
I was wondering what, you
know, it's supposed to be,

273
00:12:57,006 --> 00:12:59,084
and that's when I found the suggestion

274
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:02,095
that the minutes be what
is done not what is said.

275
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:04,997
I can understand that the,
I agree with what she said

276
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:08,464
that it said should rather than
shall so this isn't binding,

277
00:13:08,464 --> 00:13:10,435
I can understand that the City would want

278
00:13:10,435 --> 00:13:12,316
like an overview of what was discussed.

279
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:15,795
So I'm sort of like okay
with them as designed,

280
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,962
as they came forward here.

281
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:21,865
You know, my understanding
though, right now,

282
00:13:21,865 --> 00:13:24,874
is I think we just approved the amendment

283
00:13:24,874 --> 00:13:26,984
so that we could now
make a motion to dismiss,

284
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:28,804
or overturn that amendment if you want.

285
00:13:28,804 --> 00:13:31,457
If we're already gonna let this one go-

286
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:32,656
- Well, I-

287
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:34,476
- But we just struck out those-

288
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:35,886
- Yeah, so-

289
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:37,485
- I feel like that-
- Sprawling dialogue.

290
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:39,564
- Spaces where we feel it's necessary

291
00:13:39,564 --> 00:13:41,177
in those meeting specifically

292
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:42,257
and the minutes from those meetings

293
00:13:42,257 --> 00:13:43,897
we could go and strike whatever.

294
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:47,031
- I don't know that, unless the City has

295
00:13:47,031 --> 00:13:50,465
some reasoning, Brenda,
that we really should have

296
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:52,465
those comments back in there.

297
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,673
If it's not gonna matter,

298
00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:55,794
I think we should just move
forward with the agenda.

299
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:56,627
Your thoughts?

300
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,652
- I can tell you that there
are certain City policies

301
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:01,130
that have been placed,

302
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,681
there's certain department policies too.

303
00:14:03,681 --> 00:14:06,186
So this is why I'm gonna check and verify

304
00:14:06,186 --> 00:14:08,839
about content in certain things

305
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,058
of what needs to be
included in those minutes.

306
00:14:12,058 --> 00:14:13,735
- We need to undo the amendment.

307
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:14,568
- So is-

308
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:16,159
- Well but that strikes me as odd

309
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:19,601
because that isn't reflected in City code,

310
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:22,024
since the City code has the-

311
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:22,991
- Well there's-

312
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:25,740
- The Advisory Board doesn't
have any special designation

313
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,090
for how minutes should be taken.

314
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,976
- There's City code,
and then there's policy.

315
00:14:29,976 --> 00:14:30,809
- Right, I-

316
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:33,798
- And policy is not
always enshrined in code.

317
00:14:33,798 --> 00:14:35,709
And so for this stuff, I think,

318
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,978
for example the Clerk's Office is trying

319
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:42,311
to streamline all of the
Advisory Board proceedings.

320
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,570
So, for example this nice young man,

321
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:52,396
who's new to our city, three
days in, don't scare him.

322
00:14:52,396 --> 00:14:54,289
(board members chuckling)

323
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:57,372
If he's not already scared.
- Welcome.

324
00:14:58,255 --> 00:15:01,588
- So, you know, everybody takes minutes,

325
00:15:02,457 --> 00:15:06,205
they get uploaded into our Civic Clerk,

326
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,924
theoretically, platform,

327
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:12,475
and so then the minutes can get published.

328
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:14,076
- So all right, let's
cut to the chase here.

329
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:16,694
Brenda is there a reason you believe

330
00:15:16,694 --> 00:15:20,157
that we should have
those comments in there?

331
00:15:20,157 --> 00:15:22,703
That it would be important for us to

332
00:15:22,703 --> 00:15:25,622
put those comments back
in, or is it gonna matter?

333
00:15:25,622 --> 00:15:27,956
- I think we can go
ahead and leave it as is

334
00:15:27,956 --> 00:15:31,056
with the strike through, but
I would just request that

335
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:34,867
we can perhaps report back
on, again, the City Clerk,

336
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,984
the city wide policies regarding minutes

337
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:38,965
and minute preparation.

338
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:43,223
'Cause I know that we
did go through retraining

339
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:45,713
about minutes, preparation.

340
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:47,034
The difference between minutes,

341
00:15:47,034 --> 00:15:50,779
and the difference
between an action summary.

342
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:53,599
When you have to have a
summary, when it's not approved,

343
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,459
an action summary is
different than minutes.

344
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:57,881
But the City Commission
has the same thing,

345
00:15:57,881 --> 00:15:59,958
they have an action summary, pretty much,

346
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,480
versus the minutes, there's a
distinction between the two.

347
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,361
- Okay, so to Melissa's point,

348
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:07,540
maybe we look at it case by case, I guess.

349
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,128
If somebody has an objection to something

350
00:16:09,128 --> 00:16:11,320
specific in there in the future,

351
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,690
but at this point we'll just work with

352
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,351
what we have approved at this point.

353
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:16,389
Everybody okay with that?

354
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:17,222
- Yup.

355
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:19,805
- All right, moving forward to,

356
00:16:21,537 --> 00:16:23,191
already did the minutes, okay.

357
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:27,691
Old business, nothing there,
new business, 5A, Brenda?

358
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:33,502
- Okay, this is a City
initiated land use amendment

359
00:16:33,502 --> 00:16:35,979
that's gonna change approximately 27 acres

360
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:38,991
of the properties that
are highlighted in red.

361
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:42,271
This general area is an
industrial hub, if you will,

362
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:45,121
of the city, Armstrong Boulevard,

363
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:47,161
just north of the airport.

364
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:49,369
The City and Development
Services, our staff,

365
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:52,442
has received increase in request

366
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:54,448
to develop addition warehousing

367
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:56,872
on the vacant properties
that you see there.

368
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:58,620
There's a total of 14 parcels,

369
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,090
and of the 14, six of them remain vacant.

370
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,679
The current mixed use Vine
future land use designation

371
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,898
does not facilitate

372
00:17:06,898 --> 00:17:10,596
any additional warehouse within this area.

373
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,897
So we're requesting the land use amendment

374
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:16,549
to chance it to industrial
to further facilitate that.

375
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:20,922
As you can see that there's a
number of existing warehouses

376
00:17:20,922 --> 00:17:22,627
within this area.

377
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:26,960
Had made mention that the
warehousing has been built

378
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,480
and developed between 1971 and 2008.

379
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,046
That mixed use Vine land use amendment

380
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:37,914
was established in 2010, so
a lot of that development

381
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:42,105
predates the mixed use designation itself.

382
00:17:42,105 --> 00:17:43,625
In addition, I do want to point out

383
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:47,286
that we want to be
mindful and consideration

384
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:49,686
of the redevelopment efforts that we have

385
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:53,125
on the west Vine Street,
on the Vine Street corridor

386
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:56,632
that this land use amendment
will continue to allow for

387
00:17:56,632 --> 00:18:00,274
industrial development, but
the intensity, if you will,

388
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:01,946
will be restricted.

389
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:04,956
Currently, right now, the mixed use Vine

390
00:18:04,956 --> 00:18:07,214
allows for an FAR of six.

391
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:11,286
It will be substantially
reduced, down to 0.5.

392
00:18:11,286 --> 00:18:14,084
So it will allow for
industrial development,

393
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:16,484
but not as intense or large

394
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:18,843
as the existing development that's there.

395
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:20,986
As you can tell, some
of the properties there

396
00:18:20,986 --> 00:18:23,546
are a bit smaller, too, as well,

397
00:18:23,546 --> 00:18:26,017
so we're doing this to
allow for the opportunity

398
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:28,176
for warehousing, but not as large

399
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:31,904
as some of the existing
development that's there.

400
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:35,766
The nearest residential
areas are going to be

401
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:37,638
on the east side of Oak Street there,

402
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:39,793
on the Dyre Boulevard and Oak Street

403
00:18:39,793 --> 00:18:41,464
on the southeast corner,

404
00:18:41,464 --> 00:18:43,195
is the nearest residential development.

405
00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:46,756
So we definitely want
to be mindful of that.

406
00:18:46,756 --> 00:18:49,074
And we've got the airport there,

407
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:51,864
a little bit on the southwest
side to show the airport

408
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:55,516
and the close proximity
to the airport itself.

409
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:59,585
And it will further attract
different types of warehousing,

410
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:01,344
that includes logistics

411
00:19:01,344 --> 00:19:04,063
and also air cargo and transportation.

412
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:08,615
So we feel that this amendment
is necessary and needed,

413
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:11,784
and staff is recommending
approval at this time.

414
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,823
Welcome to answer any questions

415
00:19:13,823 --> 00:19:15,783
or concerns that you all may have.

416
00:19:15,783 --> 00:19:17,955
- Board, do you have any
comments or questions?

417
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:19,984
- Yeah.
- Alex, go ahead.

418
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:23,734
- So, yeah, when I was
looking at the motion,

419
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:27,003
why does it, is there a reason why

420
00:19:27,003 --> 00:19:29,344
one of the parcels isn't included?

421
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:32,894
So like looking at the
current future land use map

422
00:19:32,894 --> 00:19:34,332
most of the parcels south of here

423
00:19:34,332 --> 00:19:36,912
are already designated
industrial business,

424
00:19:36,912 --> 00:19:41,079
but that one at 931 Armstrong
Boulevard, Kissimmee

425
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,749
would be left is MUV.

426
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:44,950
- Yeah.
- What's the deal there?

427
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,783
- Yeah, we had talked about that,

428
00:19:46,783 --> 00:19:49,718
just even before the meeting.

429
00:19:49,718 --> 00:19:52,200
Either a couple of things
that we weren't able to

430
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,862
reach out to those property owners.

431
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:55,821
Even though these things
are City-initiated,

432
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:59,178
we like to coordinate and to
let the property owners know

433
00:19:59,178 --> 00:20:00,740
that we're going through this process,

434
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,481
we're gonna do this for them.

435
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:06,138
So at this time with the
background information,

436
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,138
we did not receive that.

437
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,987
At some point that is
gonna create a problem

438
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:12,788
because now it's gonna be an enclave,

439
00:20:12,788 --> 00:20:15,787
but one of the good things about it is

440
00:20:15,787 --> 00:20:18,954
it's already developed already, as is,

441
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:25,117
unlike the vacant pieces of
property that's remaining,

442
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:27,776
but we're gonna have to address
that at some point in time.

443
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:30,505
We were just talking about
that before the meeting.

444
00:20:30,505 --> 00:20:32,755
- Yeah, it strikes a bit...

445
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,011
So you also say that it wouldn't be,

446
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:37,562
I guess I didn't understand
trying to look at

447
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:39,684
the designation in the comprehensive plan

448
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:42,742
for the MUV future land use designation.

449
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,694
Why are warehouses not permitted?

450
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:49,383
It seems like it's a very
permissive designation.

451
00:20:49,383 --> 00:20:52,103
- Right, the warehouses
were there prior to

452
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:54,193
that mixed use Vine designation.

453
00:20:54,193 --> 00:20:56,163
- Yeah I guess, in
reading it, it's not clear

454
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:59,115
that warehouses would be
prohibited going forward,

455
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:00,809
or new warehouses would be prohibited-

456
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:02,571
- Well the overall objective

457
00:21:02,571 --> 00:21:06,741
of that mixed use Vine
is primarily commercial.

458
00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:08,251
It's primarily commercial,

459
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:12,327
and it's not really
conducive to industrial.

460
00:21:12,327 --> 00:21:15,060
The flip side, the zoning categories,

461
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,309
this is land use, this is not zoning,

462
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,501
the zoning category that's
ideal for mixed use Vine

463
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:23,199
does not allow for that warehousing.

464
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:26,290
So the land use sets the
stage for that zoning.

465
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,123
- Yeah.

466
00:21:27,123 --> 00:21:29,359
- And so that current mixed
use Vine is not conducive

467
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:32,437
or compatible, really, for any type of

468
00:21:32,437 --> 00:21:34,710
additional light warehousing.

469
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,557
- But I guess, yeah, but specifically here

470
00:21:36,557 --> 00:21:38,539
we're talking about the
future land use amendment

471
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:40,709
and I, you know, correct me if I'm wrong,

472
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:44,195
but looking at the MUV
future land use designation

473
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:45,780
that does seem to be very permissive

474
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,691
and would that explicitly forbid
new warehouse development?

475
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:53,701
- The land use itself, goals,
objectives, and policies-

476
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:55,428
- Yeah.
- But the zoning-

477
00:21:55,428 --> 00:21:58,459
- Sure, but that's not what's
under consideration here.

478
00:21:58,459 --> 00:21:59,778
- It would prohibit.

479
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:03,326
The land use, again, goals,
objectives, and policies,

480
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:06,396
the overall goals,
objectives, and policies

481
00:22:06,396 --> 00:22:08,054
it does not support industrial.

482
00:22:08,054 --> 00:22:12,245
And the zoning clearly
does not allow for it.

483
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:13,948
- But I guess the motion before us today

484
00:22:13,948 --> 00:22:16,938
is regarding future land use,
it's not regarding zoning.

485
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:18,419
Correct?

486
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:19,252
Gotcha.

487
00:22:21,736 --> 00:22:22,569
Yeah.

488
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:25,173
I guess, so I also have a
question in the sense that

489
00:22:25,173 --> 00:22:27,788
looking at, you know, one
of the main objectives

490
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:29,675
in the comprehensive plan is, you know,

491
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:32,853
objective 1.1.5 to promote
land use strategies

492
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,196
and research conservation,

493
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:37,205
including in the community
redevelopment areas,

494
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:40,417
including the Vine Street community CRA.

495
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:42,101
Looking at the future land use map

496
00:22:42,101 --> 00:22:46,457
it seems like basically the
entirety of the Vine Street CRA

497
00:22:46,457 --> 00:22:50,097
is designated as future
land use designation MUV.

498
00:22:50,097 --> 00:22:53,094
These parcels are part of
the current Vine Street CRA,

499
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:55,981
and these would now be
the only IN designated

500
00:22:55,981 --> 00:22:59,205
future land use in the Vine Street CR.

501
00:22:59,205 --> 00:23:02,912
Do we need to worry that
that sets up a conflict

502
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,394
of the type that we are
supposed to protect against

503
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:09,594
as the Planning Advisory Board and policy?

504
00:23:09,594 --> 00:23:11,002
- No, no.

505
00:23:11,002 --> 00:23:13,922
Because there actually is another area,

506
00:23:13,922 --> 00:23:18,839
another industrial hub, that's
on the east side of the city

507
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:22,893
that has same situation, mixed use Vine,

508
00:23:22,893 --> 00:23:24,390
and it has an existing industrial,

509
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,092
it's called the Kelly
Industrial Park area.

510
00:23:27,092 --> 00:23:29,191
So this would not create a precedence,

511
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:32,543
we have other pockets
in the same situation.

512
00:23:32,543 --> 00:23:34,630
- But this would, these
parcels still would be

513
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,743
part of the Vine Street CRA.

514
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:38,371
Changing the future land use to IN

515
00:23:38,371 --> 00:23:39,863
wouldn't remove them from that-

516
00:23:39,863 --> 00:23:40,696
- Correct.

517
00:23:40,696 --> 00:23:43,303
It would still be part
of the Vine Street CRA.

518
00:23:43,303 --> 00:23:44,136
- Right.

519
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:46,144
- CRA's a completely
different from the land use,

520
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:47,790
yes, it will remain in the CRA.

521
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:51,032
We're not removing the
properties from the CRA.

522
00:23:51,032 --> 00:23:52,632
- Do we need to be, then, concerned

523
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:54,810
because one of the things
we're supposed to do,

524
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:59,727
especially in the, you know,
the transit development areas,

525
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:02,032
the mixed use development areas,

526
00:24:02,032 --> 00:24:03,171
one of the things we're supposed to do

527
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:06,730
is encourage permissive
future land use and zoning

528
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,813
and, you know, mixed use.

529
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:13,320
Changing from a mixed use
future land use designation

530
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,719
to a single use designation seems like

531
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:18,038
it could be in conflict with that policy.

532
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:18,871
- Right.

533
00:24:19,802 --> 00:24:22,369
I do not think that
this is part of the TOD,

534
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:24,032
transit oriented development.

535
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:25,462
There are specific areas

536
00:24:25,462 --> 00:24:28,153
that are called out in the
comp plan that are TOD,

537
00:24:28,153 --> 00:24:32,272
one of them being the
downtown inter-modal areas.

538
00:24:32,272 --> 00:24:33,741
This is part of the MMTD,

539
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:37,844
with the multi-modal
transportation district, MMTD.

540
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:40,162
- Right, and policy 1.1.6.1 says

541
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,634
to enable mixed use transit
or development pattern

542
00:24:42,634 --> 00:24:43,967
within the MMTD.

543
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:49,847
And it, I mean, it feels
like one could feel as though

544
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:52,642
changing future land use from MUV to IN

545
00:24:52,642 --> 00:24:56,975
could be in, you know, could
be against that policy.

546
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,342
It would not be encouraging
mixed use within the MMTD.

547
00:25:02,342 --> 00:25:06,925
- Within this industrial
area, being it's most intense,

548
00:25:08,452 --> 00:25:11,874
you need to be really careful
about mixture of uses anyway.

549
00:25:11,874 --> 00:25:12,707
With industrial.

550
00:25:12,707 --> 00:25:15,872
Industrial is the most
intense type of land use,

551
00:25:15,872 --> 00:25:18,753
and the most intense type of zoning

552
00:25:18,753 --> 00:25:21,763
where you don't necessarily
want to have residential.

553
00:25:21,763 --> 00:25:24,452
This is why I pointed
out that the residential

554
00:25:24,452 --> 00:25:27,414
is not immediately adjacent to this,

555
00:25:27,414 --> 00:25:29,013
but within industrial areas,

556
00:25:29,013 --> 00:25:31,013
you really need to be very careful

557
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:34,914
about the mixture of uses,
which is one of the reasons why

558
00:25:34,914 --> 00:25:36,214
that we're moving forward with this.

559
00:25:36,214 --> 00:25:38,272
'Cause industrial is one of those uses

560
00:25:38,272 --> 00:25:41,122
that you need to be very careful about

561
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,822
to where there's mixture of uses.

562
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:46,711
Mixed use can be very
difficult in industrial areas

563
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,894
because we need to have
industrial areas within a city,

564
00:25:49,894 --> 00:25:52,630
because of the noxious,
intense types of uses,

565
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:56,135
but they don't necessarily
mix, if you will.

566
00:25:56,135 --> 00:25:57,325
- And these aren't currently designated

567
00:25:57,325 --> 00:25:58,771
as industrial business, right?

568
00:25:58,771 --> 00:26:00,938
They're designated as MUV.

569
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,190
- But the zoning side of it is a PUD

570
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:11,189
that has industrial
types of uses within it.

571
00:26:12,142 --> 00:26:15,282
So this is cleaning up an
inconsistency, if you will,

572
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,741
even with the zoning categories

573
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:20,782
that are on these properties.

574
00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:23,673
- Do we have any other board
member comments or questions?

575
00:26:23,673 --> 00:26:25,763
I will say that I drive past this area,

576
00:26:25,763 --> 00:26:28,773
not as a point of any
research on this agenda item,

577
00:26:28,773 --> 00:26:32,642
but I drive past this area
literally every 5 days a week

578
00:26:32,642 --> 00:26:35,243
and I know the area very
well as I go down to

579
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:38,024
Osceola High School, and I don't see

580
00:26:38,024 --> 00:26:42,607
a problem with this land use
being industrial business,

581
00:26:44,093 --> 00:26:46,451
based on what's there now.

582
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:47,634
That's my opinion.

583
00:26:47,634 --> 00:26:50,873
I will ask if we have any public comments,

584
00:26:50,873 --> 00:26:52,743
and we have one person
from the public here,

585
00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:54,522
Mr. Jerry Gemskie.

586
00:26:54,522 --> 00:26:57,355
Sir, do you have any public
comments you'd like to make?

587
00:26:57,355 --> 00:26:58,605
- None.
- Okay.

588
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,757
So, I've asked for public comments.

589
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:08,292
Regarding this agenda item,
do we have any motions?

590
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:09,242
- I'll make a motion to approve.

591
00:27:09,242 --> 00:27:11,049
- We have a motion to
approve from Melissa Thacker.

592
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:12,577
Do we have a second?
- I'll second it.

593
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:15,149
- We have a second from Robert.

594
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:17,982
Do we have any further discussion?

595
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,017
Any further discussion?

596
00:27:20,017 --> 00:27:24,434
- I mean, I guess, I feel
like I'm inclined to reject

597
00:27:28,097 --> 00:27:30,640
because I feel I don't understand,

598
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,349
I don't think the city made clear why

599
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:34,129
the future land use designation,

600
00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:36,329
which is the thing that's
under question today,

601
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:39,330
prevents the use of these
properties for warehousing

602
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,196
as they wanted.

603
00:27:40,196 --> 00:27:42,253
There's a zoning issue that
might come before the Board

604
00:27:42,253 --> 00:27:44,863
in the future, but that's not
the issue before us today,

605
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,763
and I feel like it is in
violation of the policies

606
00:27:47,763 --> 00:27:50,915
of the comprehensive plan
where we were, you know,

607
00:27:50,915 --> 00:27:52,355
put in as stewards that are trying to

608
00:27:52,355 --> 00:27:55,173
encourage mixed use
development in the MMTD,

609
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,315
and this is in the MMTD,
and this is a move away

610
00:27:57,315 --> 00:28:01,065
from mixed use future
land use to single use.

611
00:28:02,203 --> 00:28:03,440
- Okay.

612
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,190
Any other discussion?

613
00:28:06,722 --> 00:28:09,722
If not, all in favor please say aye.

614
00:28:10,786 --> 00:28:11,755
- Aye.

615
00:28:11,755 --> 00:28:13,082
- Opposed, please say no.

616
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:14,454
- No.

617
00:28:14,454 --> 00:28:18,037
- Okay, the eyes carry,
and motion carries.

618
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,035
Public hearings, we have none,

619
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:26,506
discussion 7-8, Planning
Advisory Board workshop.

620
00:28:26,506 --> 00:28:28,955
- Yeah, and I think I may have
probably flipped this around

621
00:28:28,955 --> 00:28:32,453
but we like to have,
schedule tentative dates.

622
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:33,765
I know the summer's coming up,

623
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:37,015
but I think it's fitting to consider

624
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,553
planning an Advisory Board workshop,

625
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:43,214
but skipping over the
7B, I wanted to point out

626
00:28:43,214 --> 00:28:45,093
that we do have reappointments.

627
00:28:45,093 --> 00:28:48,115
We have two of our Planning
Advisory Board members

628
00:28:48,115 --> 00:28:50,643
with terms expiring at the end of May.

629
00:28:50,643 --> 00:28:51,554
- Who's that?

630
00:28:51,554 --> 00:28:53,554
- Diana, and Ms. Fatima.

631
00:28:56,265 --> 00:29:00,485
They had opportunities to reach out to us

632
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:03,135
to see whether or not they are
interested in reappointment.

633
00:29:03,135 --> 00:29:05,891
Diana, I think it's going
to the City Commission

634
00:29:05,891 --> 00:29:10,632
sometime in May, but we
would like to have, Fatima,

635
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:12,324
that she's going to be moving on

636
00:29:12,324 --> 00:29:14,693
to other future endeavors,

637
00:29:14,693 --> 00:29:18,360
so we'd like to appreciate
your volunteerism

638
00:29:19,644 --> 00:29:22,661
and your involvement with
the Planning Advisory Board,

639
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:26,828
and she has opted to not
seek a reappointment term

640
00:29:27,702 --> 00:29:29,601
to the Planning Advisory Board.

641
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,684
So we will have a vacancy

642
00:29:33,629 --> 00:29:36,871
for a Planning Advisory Board member.

643
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:39,391
- So we should probably delay our workshop

644
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:42,331
until we're fully staffed, so to speak?

645
00:29:42,331 --> 00:29:43,164
- Yes.

646
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:46,052
So what will happen, just so you all know,

647
00:29:46,052 --> 00:29:48,804
that she will continue
to serve on the Board

648
00:29:48,804 --> 00:29:51,554
until City Commission reappoints.

649
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:53,584
- Okay.

650
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:56,262
- So that way it won't affect
quorums and what have you,

651
00:29:56,262 --> 00:30:00,452
so it may be after May
31st, but if we have not,

652
00:30:00,452 --> 00:30:04,630
City Commission has not
appointed a replacement,

653
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,811
she will continue to
serve until such a time.

654
00:30:06,811 --> 00:30:08,651
I think one time that happened where

655
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:09,943
it was a couple of months where

656
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:13,943
a board member continued
until we had a vacancy,

657
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,645
or a reappointment.

658
00:30:16,645 --> 00:30:17,603
- Okay.

659
00:30:17,603 --> 00:30:22,603
And 7B, does that, is that
inclusive of what you just said?

660
00:30:22,802 --> 00:30:24,272
- Yes, I think just in general,

661
00:30:24,272 --> 00:30:26,882
for every board member to
know where they're at with it

662
00:30:26,882 --> 00:30:29,442
because it was deliberate,
where it's tiered.

663
00:30:29,442 --> 00:30:31,921
So this year we have two board members,

664
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:34,824
I think next year, in 2025,
we have two board members,

665
00:30:34,824 --> 00:30:36,435
and then the following year is two

666
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,983
so that way it's staggered,

667
00:30:38,983 --> 00:30:40,304
so that way, to make
sure that we don't have

668
00:30:40,304 --> 00:30:43,441
like four or five vacancies
on the Board at the same time.

669
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,592
- Mass resignation, vacancy.

670
00:30:45,592 --> 00:30:46,425
- No.

671
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:47,258
It happens, we understand.

672
00:30:47,258 --> 00:30:49,101
So I think it was just
more for informational

673
00:30:49,101 --> 00:30:50,352
for all the board members to know

674
00:30:50,352 --> 00:30:52,393
exactly where they are with their terms

675
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:53,853
and the appointments.

676
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,795
So I think, from what I'm hearing,

677
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:58,245
until we get the reappointments done,

678
00:30:58,245 --> 00:31:01,574
then we'll have and schedule a workshop.

679
00:31:01,574 --> 00:31:04,631
- I think that makes sense.
- For the workshop.

680
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:06,970
- What's everybody else's opinion on that?

681
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,192
- When's the workshop?

682
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:09,690
- Well we don't, that's the idea

683
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,843
is that we wouldn't set it until we have

684
00:31:11,843 --> 00:31:14,261
our group here fully staffed.

685
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:15,251
- Yeah, that's what I wanted to know.

686
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:19,483
- Also, you guys, think about
what you want, you know,

687
00:31:19,483 --> 00:31:22,571
remedial courses on, in a workshop.

688
00:31:22,571 --> 00:31:24,673
So brainstorm a little bit.

689
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:25,506
- Be careful. (chuckles)

690
00:31:25,506 --> 00:31:28,092
- About what you think
you need refreshers on.

691
00:31:28,092 --> 00:31:30,571
We'll be the same from
a staff perspective,

692
00:31:30,571 --> 00:31:34,559
but, you know, if you guys
have burning questions

693
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,012
of how does this all work,
what are we supposed to do,

694
00:31:39,012 --> 00:31:41,511
conflicts, all that good stuff.

695
00:31:41,511 --> 00:31:43,131
- So one thing I noticed,
it was news to me

696
00:31:43,131 --> 00:31:45,441
reading the City code,
but apparently this body

697
00:31:45,441 --> 00:31:48,601
is also the Brown Field development

698
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:50,111
overseeing body of the city?

699
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:51,551
- Yes, that is 100% correct.

700
00:31:51,551 --> 00:31:53,240
- I don't know anything about Brown Field.

701
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,835
- Okay, that's a good one.
- That would be good to know.

702
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:58,366
- Okay, we can definitely work on that.

703
00:31:58,366 --> 00:31:59,295
- Good update.

704
00:31:59,295 --> 00:32:03,532
- That is something that
does not come up very often,

705
00:32:03,532 --> 00:32:06,584
but we have in the past few years-

706
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:08,314
- It's hard to see our end-
- Yeah.

707
00:32:08,314 --> 00:32:09,614
(board member speaking indistinctly)

708
00:32:09,614 --> 00:32:13,913
Yeah, we can definitely bring
in a bigger discussion of that

709
00:32:13,913 --> 00:32:17,781
'cause that is good stuff that we do.

710
00:32:17,781 --> 00:32:18,614
Yeah.

711
00:32:23,096 --> 00:32:24,765
- Okay, this was just tentative dates

712
00:32:24,765 --> 00:32:28,612
and kind of talk it through
and that way we know

713
00:32:28,612 --> 00:32:31,262
just from a planning standpoint.

714
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:34,759
And then after that too we'll talk about

715
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:38,859
appointments of Chair and
Vice Chair too, potentially.

716
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:41,921
- When does the city,
when would they be looking

717
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:44,159
to replace Fatima?

718
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,480
- I think it's the second
meeting in May, I think-

719
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,458
- Okay, so it's coming up.

720
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:51,150
- City Clerk, yes.
- Oh, okay.

721
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:54,932
- Are there people being proposed for-

722
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:55,765
- I don't know.

723
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,058
A lot of times, that's the thing,

724
00:32:58,058 --> 00:33:01,227
that they actually, the
commissioners will appoint,

725
00:33:01,227 --> 00:33:04,319
or the applications coming
in, or they'll appoint,

726
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,659
but they can also request
additional time, too, as well,

727
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:09,659
to consider the vacancy.

728
00:33:10,498 --> 00:33:12,327
And I think there's like a cycle,

729
00:33:12,327 --> 00:33:15,676
for each of the commissioners
to be responsible for

730
00:33:15,676 --> 00:33:19,117
a replacement on an Advisory Board.

731
00:33:19,117 --> 00:33:20,669
So I think that is coming up.

732
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:21,708
- Does anyone want to through a date,

733
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:25,269
a couple of dates out there
that would work for them?

734
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,368
Summer is kind of in flux for me

735
00:33:27,368 --> 00:33:29,400
with travel and stuff at the moment,

736
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,317
so I don't really know.

737
00:33:33,216 --> 00:33:34,066
- Well you know we're here

738
00:33:34,066 --> 00:33:37,808
on the first and the third
Wednesday of every month, so.

739
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:39,631
- Hmm?
- Whenever you guys-

740
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:40,801
- Yeah, I guess, you know.

741
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:44,884
But I'm probably going to
be doing some traveling

742
00:33:46,702 --> 00:33:48,380
at some point, I don't
miss too many meetings,

743
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,510
but there may be one.

744
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:54,010
But don't need to hold up that for me, so-

745
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,633
- We can revisit again once we know

746
00:33:57,633 --> 00:34:01,110
what the reappointments and
vacancies and things like that.

747
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:05,899
And we can even halve it,
or we can maybe do one

748
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:08,269
after something and we can
break it apart if we need to.

749
00:34:08,269 --> 00:34:09,598
- How long would we be talking about?

750
00:34:09,598 --> 00:34:11,141
'Cause we've had some that were lengthier.

751
00:34:11,141 --> 00:34:13,448
- Yeah, I mean we can break it apart.

752
00:34:13,448 --> 00:34:15,779
You know, we can do one
Robert's Rule, comp plan,

753
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:17,088
one time, and then-

754
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,809
- We don't want to bore you guys,

755
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:21,142
we just want to educate you.

756
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:25,116
Robert is, he's so over this, okay.

757
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:30,317
But, I mean, maybe like
an hour with Brown Fields?

758
00:34:32,022 --> 00:34:34,742
But we can push this into like the fall,

759
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:39,052
'cause the summer is kind
of difficult for everybody.

760
00:34:39,052 --> 00:34:42,640
And by the time we get, you
know, the band back together-

761
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,970
- Somewhere around September?
- Yeah.

762
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,822
- I mean I intend to
come to every meeting,

763
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:49,450
but we probably will
be doing some traveling

764
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,164
as a family at some point in the summer,

765
00:34:51,164 --> 00:34:52,011
so there could be a chance

766
00:34:52,011 --> 00:34:55,300
that I miss one of those meetings,

767
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,460
and I would like to be
around for a workshop.

768
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,293
- Okay.

769
00:34:58,293 --> 00:34:59,271
- So if we can do it in September,

770
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:01,614
my preference would be
September or October

771
00:35:01,614 --> 00:35:03,672
or something after summer.

772
00:35:03,672 --> 00:35:05,141
What does everybody else think?

773
00:35:05,141 --> 00:35:07,140
- That works for me, September's good.

774
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:07,973
- We can take a look at that,

775
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:10,774
because we also tend not to have,

776
00:35:10,774 --> 00:35:11,795
where we don't have any items,

777
00:35:11,795 --> 00:35:14,332
so it's just dedicated
just for the workshop,

778
00:35:14,332 --> 00:35:15,869
not any items, so it also depends on

779
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:18,146
where we're at with items and things.

780
00:35:18,146 --> 00:35:19,394
- Mm-hmm.

781
00:35:19,394 --> 00:35:21,796
Okay.
- Okay, that's all I have.

782
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:23,168
- I want to say something.
- Yes.

783
00:35:23,168 --> 00:35:25,757
- I want to say thank you for allowing me

784
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,156
to be part of this board,

785
00:35:27,156 --> 00:35:30,219
and it has been very educational for me

786
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:32,157
and informational too.

787
00:35:32,157 --> 00:35:35,386
So it's been a pleasure,
and thank you so much,

788
00:35:35,386 --> 00:35:37,436
and I hope that you guys continue

789
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:40,075
doing an amazing job,
like you have been doing.

790
00:35:40,075 --> 00:35:41,742
Thanks.
- Thank you.

791
00:35:43,814 --> 00:35:46,456
Anyone else, comments?

792
00:35:46,456 --> 00:35:47,289
Alex?

793
00:35:48,238 --> 00:35:51,187
- So, okay, one thing I'm
sort of interested in,

794
00:35:51,187 --> 00:35:53,854
I'm not sure whether we need to,

795
00:35:54,845 --> 00:35:56,145
whether I need to make
a motion or something,

796
00:35:56,145 --> 00:35:58,034
but one thing I'd be sort of interested in

797
00:35:58,034 --> 00:36:00,754
is again looking at
the comprehensive plan,

798
00:36:00,754 --> 00:36:04,193
one of the policies sets level of service

799
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:06,304
and quality of service
standards for the city.

800
00:36:06,304 --> 00:36:07,396
Both the roadways

801
00:36:07,396 --> 00:36:10,804
and the pedestrian and
bike infrastructure.

802
00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:13,650
The comprehensive plan was adopted in 2020

803
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,700
and the first goals that
it sets are for 2030,

804
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,209
so we're about half way there.

805
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,969
So I'd be kind of curious to hear,

806
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:22,077
you know, an update from the city

807
00:36:22,077 --> 00:36:25,087
on what quality of service is,
how its changed since 2020,

808
00:36:25,087 --> 00:36:26,498
and whether we're on track to meet

809
00:36:26,498 --> 00:36:30,559
the goals set out in
the comprehensive plan.

810
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:32,747
I don't know if that's just
something I can request

811
00:36:32,747 --> 00:36:35,296
or whether you would prefer if the body

812
00:36:35,296 --> 00:36:37,717
like made a motion to hear
a report from the city

813
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:39,300
or something, yeah.

814
00:36:44,508 --> 00:36:46,018
- There's different avenues to that.

815
00:36:46,018 --> 00:36:48,714
Our long range planning team, probably,

816
00:36:48,714 --> 00:36:51,547
but I know that we're gearing up

817
00:36:51,547 --> 00:36:54,668
for some ear based evaluation
and appraisal report

818
00:36:54,668 --> 00:36:57,668
which is a state requirement anyway.

819
00:36:58,693 --> 00:37:02,776
- Brenda, are they gonna,
is Ashley gonna present

820
00:37:04,215 --> 00:37:07,465
your stuff to PAB?
- You would have to-

821
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:10,299
- It will have to come through
Planning Advisory Board.

822
00:37:10,299 --> 00:37:12,807
- Do you know, is it like-

823
00:37:12,807 --> 00:37:14,668
- I'm thinking that we're opting not to.

824
00:37:14,668 --> 00:37:16,876
I think we're just gonna
do the letter, I think.

825
00:37:16,876 --> 00:37:17,709
- Oh, okay.

826
00:37:17,709 --> 00:37:18,737
- 'Cause I think we're,
I know we're gonna have

827
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,368
a consultant for transportation,

828
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:22,438
but I think like required amendments?

829
00:37:22,438 --> 00:37:24,054
I think no.
- Okay.

830
00:37:24,054 --> 00:37:26,516
- But I think, I know we're gonna be

831
00:37:26,516 --> 00:37:28,945
hiring a consultant
for the transportation.

832
00:37:28,945 --> 00:37:29,778
- Okay.

833
00:37:30,855 --> 00:37:33,938
Or maybe Ashley could come give us a-

834
00:37:37,336 --> 00:37:39,377
- Ashley and (indistinct)
were the consultants-

835
00:37:39,377 --> 00:37:40,210
- Yeah.

836
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:45,127
- It's, we're going through
our piece now for a consultant.

837
00:37:48,678 --> 00:37:51,679
- Another random question,
what's the city ditch?

838
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:54,426
- What?
- What's the city ditch?

839
00:37:54,426 --> 00:37:56,259
The comprehensive plan
makes three references

840
00:37:56,259 --> 00:37:57,759
to the city ditch.

841
00:38:01,097 --> 00:38:03,910
- Did you say dish?
- Ditch, ditch.

842
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,680
- Ditch.
- Like a water ditch.

843
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,263
- I was like, yes,
their main, Mill Slough,

844
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:12,950
it's a series of probably that main Emory,

845
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:17,283
it's a huge, huge, ditch
system that travels through

846
00:38:18,288 --> 00:38:21,060
and traverses through the city.

847
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,611
- I'm sorry miss, I didn't understand.

848
00:38:22,611 --> 00:38:24,668
- Yeah, D-I-T-C-H.
- Oh, ditch!

849
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:27,427
- Ditch, ditch, D-I-T-C-H.
- Okay, okay.

850
00:38:27,427 --> 00:38:29,817
- I thought you said
dish too, so I was like

851
00:38:29,817 --> 00:38:33,591
I don't know of the official
city dish, food-wise.

852
00:38:33,591 --> 00:38:35,738
That's why, but ditch, ditch system.

853
00:38:35,738 --> 00:38:36,571
- There was some indication

854
00:38:36,571 --> 00:38:38,579
it might be in the downtown area.

855
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:41,929
Is it the like retention
pond behind the library, or?

856
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:44,652
- Part of it is Emory, the
main, or Martin Luther King,

857
00:38:44,652 --> 00:38:47,205
part of it we ditched
a couple of years ago,

858
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:49,147
we actually piped in a lot of it,

859
00:38:49,147 --> 00:38:51,547
but it's a main, main ditch system

860
00:38:51,547 --> 00:38:54,415
that traverses from the
south side of the city

861
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,554
up to the north side.

862
00:38:56,554 --> 00:38:58,644
Yes, it is a main ditch system.

863
00:38:58,644 --> 00:38:59,811
- Ditch, okay.

864
00:39:01,143 --> 00:39:03,385
- And these microphones,
from where I sit anyway,

865
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:05,544
I hear so much, it's not feedback,

866
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:08,744
but reverb or whatever,
it's really hard for me to-

867
00:39:08,744 --> 00:39:09,764
- You hear what you're
saying and then what the-

868
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,275
- Yeah, so I'm hearing it's-

869
00:39:11,275 --> 00:39:12,448
- It's the volume on this thing,

870
00:39:12,448 --> 00:39:14,383
and quite frankly this is, I'm sorry,

871
00:39:14,383 --> 00:39:18,438
I don't the iPad thing and
it's kind of hard to do that.

872
00:39:18,438 --> 00:39:19,994
- No, it's not just you
it's like everybody.

873
00:39:19,994 --> 00:39:22,847
I really struggle sometimes
to make out, clearly,

874
00:39:22,847 --> 00:39:25,597
what's being said because of the,

875
00:39:26,835 --> 00:39:28,397
I don't know if it's proximity, how close,

876
00:39:28,397 --> 00:39:31,566
are we too close, am I echoing, you know?

877
00:39:31,566 --> 00:39:34,355
So I just-
- Concentrate.

878
00:39:34,355 --> 00:39:38,022
- Yeah, so that's why
I didn't hear clearly.

879
00:39:39,357 --> 00:39:40,361
Anyone else?

880
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:42,048
- Yeah, I'm gonna keep going. (chuckles)

881
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:44,585
I had one other sort of
comment I wanted to make.

882
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:49,496
So, you know, the ship has
sailed, process played its part,

883
00:39:49,496 --> 00:39:53,853
but the motion that we
considered last time

884
00:39:53,853 --> 00:39:58,262
to give up the right of way,
just for our own edification,

885
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,163
reviewing the comprehensive plan,

886
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:01,942
the comprehensive plan is sort of explicit

887
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:05,594
in policy 2.2.1.2 that
we are supposed to ensure

888
00:40:05,594 --> 00:40:09,136
that the city preserves
its existing right of way

889
00:40:09,136 --> 00:40:14,136
and does not, you know, too
easily make street vacations.

890
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:16,895
So I just wanted to, I didn't,

891
00:40:17,886 --> 00:40:20,105
I wasn't aware of that at the time,

892
00:40:20,105 --> 00:40:23,624
but probably good to keep
in mind going forward.

893
00:40:23,624 --> 00:40:25,865
The only other thing I wanted
to comment on was, yeah-

894
00:40:25,865 --> 00:40:28,234
- Hold on, sorry, let me just make sure

895
00:40:28,234 --> 00:40:31,275
nobody else has comments
on that or anything else.

896
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:32,317
Okay, go ahead Alex.

897
00:40:32,317 --> 00:40:33,887
- And then I guess the last one was, yeah,

898
00:40:33,887 --> 00:40:35,298
reviewing our comprehensive plan

899
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:38,462
as well as Osceola county's
comprehensive plan.

900
00:40:38,462 --> 00:40:42,717
There was at least one, maybe
a couple, policies that I saw

901
00:40:42,717 --> 00:40:44,564
in the Osceola county comprehensive plan

902
00:40:44,564 --> 00:40:46,657
that we seem to be missing in character

903
00:40:46,657 --> 00:40:48,307
from the Kissimmee one.

904
00:40:48,307 --> 00:40:50,122
And looking at the City
code, one of the duties

905
00:40:50,122 --> 00:40:53,142
of this body is to propose amendments

906
00:40:53,142 --> 00:40:55,442
to the comprehensive plan

907
00:40:55,442 --> 00:40:57,454
and I guess I wanted
to take the temperature

908
00:40:57,454 --> 00:41:00,092
of whether or not we'd
be at all interested

909
00:41:00,092 --> 00:41:03,783
in proposing amendments for consideration

910
00:41:03,783 --> 00:41:06,303
by the DRC or something.

911
00:41:06,303 --> 00:41:08,982
- So what I would suggest is that

912
00:41:08,982 --> 00:41:13,149
you reach out to staff
with some of those policies

913
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:18,482
that you feel are within
the county comp plan

914
00:41:18,482 --> 00:41:21,663
and not in the City's and then sort of

915
00:41:21,663 --> 00:41:23,850
work with staff to see if, you know,

916
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,633
A, there's a reason why it's not

917
00:41:26,633 --> 00:41:29,039
part of our comprehensive plan,

918
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:30,633
but sort of start it at a staff level

919
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:33,628
before bringing it up to the Board.

920
00:41:33,628 --> 00:41:36,380
'Cause it might just be, you know,

921
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,532
a very good reason, or an oversight,

922
00:41:39,532 --> 00:41:42,287
in which it does need
to come to the Board,

923
00:41:42,287 --> 00:41:45,287
but I don't know that it's expedient

924
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:49,783
or even wise for that matter

925
00:41:51,432 --> 00:41:55,682
for members of the Board
to be proposing, you know,

926
00:41:56,929 --> 00:42:00,262
of their own volition, comp plan changes

927
00:42:02,142 --> 00:42:04,609
that are not vetted by staff.

928
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:06,276
- Gotcha, thank you.

929
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,620
- I think that, yeah, that's a smart move

930
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,540
to talk to the staff, find
out all the particulars

931
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:18,161
and the 360 on it and then,
if it's beyond our purview,

932
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,400
that's certainly always something

933
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,062
that you could take up with the Commission

934
00:42:23,062 --> 00:42:24,152
in public comments

935
00:42:24,152 --> 00:42:27,984
or communicating with the
commissioners or something,

936
00:42:27,984 --> 00:42:32,901
that you feel, or anyone feels,
should be a change overall.

937
00:42:34,631 --> 00:42:35,952
Anything else?

938
00:42:35,952 --> 00:42:36,933
Anyone?

939
00:42:36,933 --> 00:42:39,050
If not, do we have a motion
to, wait, our next meeting,

940
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,800
do we know when our next
meeting is for sure?

941
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:44,961
- No.

942
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:47,544
There's a potential, there's...

943
00:42:48,923 --> 00:42:51,940
Actually, we might have to
bring something back June 1st.

944
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,773
Yes, yes.

945
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:59,883
June 1st is the tentative item
to bring back to the Board.

946
00:43:02,451 --> 00:43:04,561
- Okay, so June 1st.
- June 1st.

947
00:43:04,561 --> 00:43:08,831
- Okay, all right, do we
have a motion to adjourn?

948
00:43:08,831 --> 00:43:10,369
- I'd like to motion to adjourn.

949
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:11,202
- Awesome.
- I'll second.

950
00:43:11,202 --> 00:43:13,901
- Robert, motion to adjourn,
I heard second from Alex,

951
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:15,483
any discussion on that?

952
00:43:15,483 --> 00:43:16,792
All in favor please say aye.

953
00:43:16,792 --> 00:43:17,625
- Aye.

954
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:18,984
- Opposed please say no.

955
00:43:18,984 --> 00:43:23,631
Carries unanimously, meeting
adjourned at 6:43, thank you.
