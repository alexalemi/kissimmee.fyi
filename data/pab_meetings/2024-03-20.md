**Date:** March 20, 2024
**Meeting Time:** Called to order at 6:02 PM
**Location:** City of Kissimmee

## Meeting Type
Regular Planning Advisory Board Meeting

## Agenda Overview
This was a brief meeting with only one substantive agenda item - a right-of-way vacation request.

## Minutes Approval
- **February 7th Minutes:** Approved unanimously after brief discussion regarding abstentions and recording procedures
- Motion to approve by Alex, seconded by Robert
- Vote: Approved (all in favor)

## Main Agenda Item: Right-of-Way Vacation Request (Item 5A)

### Project Details
- **Applicant:** Represented by Michael Hadad (Kelly Horn's representative)
- **Applicant Address:** 200 South Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida
- **Property Location:** Vine Street corridor near Oak Street intersection
- **Size:** 0.269 acres (portion of a larger parcel)
- **Right-of-Way Dimensions:** 47 feet wide by 250 feet long
- **Historical Context:** Right-of-way established in 1972 for a planned north-south roadway from Vine Street
- **Current Use:** Property has been vacant since 2011 when a commercial building was demolished
- **Proposed Development:** Hardware store (currently in development review)

### Staff Presentation (Brenda)
**Key Points:**
- The original right-of-way was intended for a north-south road connecting Vine Street to properties south, but this road was never built
- All utility providers (Toho Water, Kissimmee Utility Authority, Spectrum) were contacted
- No objections received from utility providers or city departments
- Property to the south is currently under development for multi-family apartments
- The site is located in a form-based code area
- Existing drainage issues along Vine Street frontage limit sidewalk widening possibilities

**Staff Recommendation:**
- Approve the vacation with one condition: utility easements must be dedicated either through final plat or another legal instrument

### Board Discussion

**Primary Concerns Raised by Board Member Alex:**
Alex raised extensive concerns about pedestrian and bicycle connectivity:

1. **Comprehensive Plan Alignment:** The vacation may conflict with the city's comprehensive plan goal to increase level of service for pedestrians and bicycles
2. **Vine Street Conditions:** Vine Street is currently "horrendous" for biking or walking; the area is poorly served for pedestrian traffic
3. **Lost Opportunity:** Once the right-of-way is vacated, the city loses leverage to create pedestrian connectivity in the future
4. **Alternative Proposal:** Suggested retaining 5-12 feet of the 47-foot right-of-way for a potential pedestrian path
5. **Connectivity Benefits:** A pedestrian path could serve the multi-family development to the south, avoiding lengthy detours around Oak Street to access Vine Street businesses
6. **Long-term Planning:** Expressed concern that giving up the entire right-of-way would "cement" existing connectivity issues in the corridor

**Staff Response (Brenda):**
- No city department indicated a need to retain any portion of the right-of-way during review
- The city's priority is east-west pedestrian connectivity along the Vine Street corridor itself
- City is working with FDOT on Vine Street improvements (Vine Street is a state road)
- A master landscaping plan for the Vine Street CRA was approved approximately a year ago
- Drainage and utility constraints make improvements along Vine Street challenging
- Form-based code requirements will mandate direct pedestrian connection from the property to existing Vine Street sidewalk
- Vacating the right-of-way doesn't preclude future pedestrian connections, but they would require developer cooperation
- Any future pedestrian path would depend on cooperation from the multi-family development to the south

**Other Board Member Comments:**

**Board Chair:**
- Questioned whether a pedestrian walkway would be city-funded or developer-funded
- Noted uncertainty about whether the southern development would want such access
- Asked about potential retail benefits of pedestrian traffic for the hardware store
- Staff clarified hardware stores are not high pedestrian generators like restaurants would be

**Melissa:**
- Noted the adjacent property to the south may not be conducive to through-access
- Concerned about creating a 5-foot gap that might never be developed and could become overgrown
- Expressed understanding of Alex's concerns but noted practical limitations

**Board Member (Robert/other):**
- Noted the city would retain utility access rights regardless
- The large multi-family development to the south is "locked in" and quite substantial
- Acknowledged the property has been vacant for 14-15 years

**City Attorney Clarification:**
- Vacating the right-of-way is necessary to change boundary lines for setback and buffering requirements
- The vacation doesn't necessarily mean the city loses all future opportunities
- New rights-of-way could potentially be dedicated when the property is improved/platted
- However, acknowledged the city would lose "a degree of control" and would be dependent on developer goodwill

### Key Debate Points

**Alex's Position:**
- The board's role is to consider alternatives beyond what staff recommends
- This represents a rare opportunity to improve pedestrian/bike infrastructure
- Retaining a portion (5-12 feet) of the 47-foot right-of-way would:
  - Still give the developer 35-42 feet for their parking lot
  - Preserve city options for future pedestrian improvements
  - Align with comprehensive plan goals
  - Serve the multi-family residents to the south

**Counter-Arguments:**
- Feasibility unknown due to drainage/swale issues
- Would require coordination with southern development (may have walls/fencing planned)
- City priority is east-west connectivity along Vine Street, not north-south
- Development is small and wouldn't trigger street requirements
- Hardware store is not a high pedestrian generator
- May create an undeveloped gap that becomes problematic

### Final Decision
**Motion:** Approve the right-of-way vacation with the utility easement condition as recommended by staff
**Made by:** Board member (name not clearly stated in transcript)
**Seconded by:** Melissa
**Vote:** 4-1 (Alex voted No)
**Result:** APPROVED

The right-of-way vacation was approved with the condition that utility easements be dedicated through final plat or other legal instrument.

## Additional Context

### Site Constraints
- Large drainage swale along Vine Street frontage
- Utilities (electric, cable/Spectrum, water) present
- Located in form-based code area with specific development requirements
- Vine Street is a state road (FDOT jurisdiction), limiting city control

### Future Development Plans
- Building will be pushed toward the front (Vine Street) per form-based code
- Circulation pattern: one-way in and out access from Vine Street
- Fence planned around entire property line
- Direct pedestrian connection to Vine Street sidewalk required
- Cannot widen sidewalk due to drainage issues

### Area Context
- Nearby: Wells Fargo, restaurants, Orlando Health Physician Associates, preschool
- Multi-family apartment complex under development to the south
- Magnolia Avenue provides alternative pedestrian route (quieter than Vine Street)
- Area includes mixed commercial and residential uses

## Board Member Comments
The chair acknowledged Alex's concerns were valid and important to have on the record, emphasizing that voicing different perspectives is part of the board's responsibility. The procedural handling was to ensure efficient meeting progress while allowing full discussion.

## Next Meeting
- **Date:** April 3, 2024 (tentative)
- **Status:** Staff working on agenda item, will notify board members via email within a few days
- **Expected Items:** One item anticipated

## Meeting Adjourned
- **Motion to adjourn:** Melissa
- **Second:** Robert
- **Vote:** Unanimous
- **Time:** Approximately 7:00 PM (meeting duration approximately 1 hour)

## Summary Assessment

This meeting centered on a tension between expediting development of a long-vacant property and preserving future options for pedestrian/bicycle infrastructure improvements. While the vacation was approved as recommended by staff, the extensive discussion highlighted important planning considerations:

**Development Perspective:**
- Property vacant since 2011; vacation enables productive redevelopment
- All utilities accommodated through easement condition
- Meets form-based code requirements for urban development

**Pedestrian/Bike Connectivity Perspective:**
- Opportunity to retain leverage for future pedestrian improvements
- Alignment with comprehensive plan goals questioned
- Once vacated, right-of-way difficult to reclaim
- Area currently poorly served for non-vehicular traffic

The 4-1 vote reflects board recognition of both perspectives, with the majority favoring the staff recommendation while acknowledging the legitimate concerns about long-term pedestrian infrastructure planning.
