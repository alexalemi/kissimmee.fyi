1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,733
- Sorry.

2
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:02,670
Can you hear me now?
- Yes.

3
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,503
- Okay.

4
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,336
Good evening, everyone,

5
00:00:04,336 --> 00:00:06,540
we're gonna call the meeting to order.

6
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,790
If I could ask everyone to
silence their cell phones,

7
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,490
and we're gonna have a moment of silence

8
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,690
and say the Pledge of Allegiance.

9
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,763
You still can't hear me? It's on.

10
00:00:17,822 --> 00:00:18,756
Closer?

11
00:00:18,756 --> 00:00:19,589
Closer?

12
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:21,532
Better? There you go.

13
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:22,365
All right.

14
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:27,893
You hear me?

15
00:00:30,272 --> 00:00:31,105
One, two. One, two.

16
00:00:31,105 --> 00:00:32,220
Better?

17
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,060
All right. Awesome.

18
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,370
Okay, now we're gonna
call meeting to order.

19
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,985
Good evening, everyone,

20
00:00:36,985 --> 00:00:39,158
please silence any mobile devices,

21
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:41,220
and we will stand for
the Pledge of Allegiance

22
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,543
and a moment of silence.

23
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,240
- I pledge allegiance to the flag

24
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,960
of the United States of America,

25
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,430
and to the republic for which it stands,

26
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,670
one nation, under God, indivisible,

27
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,090
with liberty and justice for all.

28
00:01:19,063 --> 00:01:20,763
- Item three minutes.

29
00:01:22,504 --> 00:01:23,430
Do we have a motion to approve

30
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,723
the May 15th Planning Advisory
Board meeting minutes?

31
00:01:30,726 --> 00:01:32,196
Motion to approve. Second?

32
00:01:32,196 --> 00:01:33,210
- Second.

33
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,141
- All in favor?

34
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:34,974
- Aye.

35
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:39,202
- Having heard none,
the motion is approved.

36
00:01:39,202 --> 00:01:40,794
Approval...

37
00:01:40,794 --> 00:01:43,613
I'm sorry, 3B, approval of July 17th

38
00:01:43,613 --> 00:01:45,324
Planning Advisory Board meeting minutes.

39
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:46,650
Motion to approve?

40
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,140
- So, I guess I'd like to
make a motion to amend,

41
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,430
just a slight one.

42
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,483
- Okay.

43
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:52,590
- At the end of the minutes,

44
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,600
it says board member Aleni stated

45
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,280
to have the comprehensive
plan fully be accessible

46
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,540
in the city of Kissimmee's website.

47
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,030
I'd like to replace stated with requested,

48
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,866
I feel like it's just a,

49
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:03,116
you know, like,

50
00:02:04,353 --> 00:02:06,103
you know, type thing.

51
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:09,750
- Okay.

52
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,010
- So we'll do a motion with the amendment.

53
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,373
Okay. All right.

54
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,370
Motion to approve the, the May,

55
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,830
I'm sorry, the July 17th.
Planning Advisory Board minutes

56
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,827
with the approval of the amendment.

57
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:30,090
- I mean, I guess I'll,

58
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,540
yeah, I'm not sure.

59
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,040
Should we make the motion to amend?

60
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,330
Approve the motion to amend,

61
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,480
and then make the motion to,

62
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,761
or do you wanna roll them into one, or?

63
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:41,417
- We can roll them into one, correct?

64
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:43,290
And we should amend them first.

65
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,236
- Yes.

66
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:46,780
- Okay. First motion to
amend, then motion to approve.

67
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,613
Okay.

68
00:02:47,613 --> 00:02:49,952
Motion to amend the July 17th

69
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:52,110
2024 Planning Advisory Board minutes.

70
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,784
- So, I believe I'm making that motion.

71
00:02:54,784 --> 00:02:57,042
- We have a motion. Second?

72
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,235
- There you go. Okay.

73
00:02:58,235 --> 00:02:59,068
- Second?

74
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:02,847
Okay.

75
00:03:02,847 --> 00:03:03,860
All in favor?

76
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,884
- Aye.

77
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,060
- All right, having heard
none, it's approved.

78
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,330
Now, motion to approve,
with the amendments,

79
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,210
the July 17th 2024
Planning Advisory minutes.

80
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,420
- So, I will make a motion to
approve with the amendment.

81
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,320
- Seconded?

82
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,820
- Second.

83
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,260
- All in favor?
- Aye.

84
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,470
- Having heard none. Motion passes.

85
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,120
Item O, business note, there's none,

86
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,477
and under new business, 5A.

87
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,546
Good evening, this is,

88
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:41,185
can you all hear me?

89
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:42,018
Can you all hear me?

90
00:03:42,018 --> 00:03:43,373
- I don't know about that there.

91
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:02,790
- All right. I'm gonna try my
best to project a bit better.

92
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,750
- That is better.

93
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,710
- Okay.

94
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,550
This is a conditional lease
with site plan waiver approval,

95
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,280
from the property at 1504 Patrick Street,

96
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,800
to establish a childcare facility.

97
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,630
The existing improvements include

98
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,550
a 3,200 square foot building

99
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,220
that was previously approved as a church

100
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,200
via previous condition use approval

101
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,760
by the Planning Advisory Board in 1997.

102
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,350
In addition to that,

103
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,700
there were a buffer waiver

104
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,643
that was granted by the city commission,

105
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,920
that granted a buffer waiver

106
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,800
on the southern eastern
portion of the property.

107
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,133
The southern property
has a retention pond.

108
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:44,703
- There's the aerial map.

109
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,610
- The southern portion of the property

110
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,600
has a retention pond that
provided a natural buffer,

111
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,950
and on the eastern side,
there was an existing fence.

112
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:00,720
The current property owner
has recently installed a fence

113
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
on the western portion,
or on the left-hand side

114
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,520
where the open city ditch is.

115
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,650
In preparation for a childcare facility,

116
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,380
there's a fence that has been
established on the west side

117
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,513
as a barrier for the open ditch.

118
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,817
The proposed conditional use
is intended to accommodate

119
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:22,290
for the existing parking spaces,
which is 20 parking spaces,

120
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,810
can accommodate a maximum of 100 students,

121
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,570
but the property owner
is proposing a maximum

122
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,760
of 75 students.

123
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,030
So the existing
improvements can accommodate

124
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,450
the childcare facility without
any additional changes,

125
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,450
or construction, or what have
you, to the existing parcel.

126
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,850
Hence this is why staff is
supporting a site plan waiver,

127
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,010
because the improvements
are gonna be confined

128
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,540
to the inside of the building,

129
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,180
and there's an adequate amount of parking

130
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,510
to support the childcare facility,

131
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,933
and there's no additional
buffers that's required.

132
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,270
There was a land use
amendment and rezoning

133
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,490
that was approved, actually last night,

134
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,952
so part of the submittal

135
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:11,850
and the supplemental
information that you have

136
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,800
after the publication

137
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,170
of this planning advisory board meeting

138
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,300
is the City Commission action

139
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,610
confirming that that land use amendment

140
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,510
LUPA 24-002 and ZMA 24-001

141
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,980
was approved at last night's
City Commission meeting,

142
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,270
so I'm just providing you proof

143
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,640
of that city commission action,

144
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,228
and that we can move forward

145
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,110
with the approval of
this childcare facility.

146
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,080
It's compatible within
the surrounding area,

147
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,247
and it is needed,

148
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:44,970
and it's encouraged and
supported by city staff.

149
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,040
At this point in time, staff
is recommending approval

150
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,130
subject to the conditions

151
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,710
that are listed within the staff report.

152
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,150
And I'm here to answer any questions,

153
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,310
we also have the property owner as well

154
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,710
that can answer any
questions that you may have.

155
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:01,017
- Okay.

156
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,510
Does the board have any
questions before we?

157
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,343
- No.

158
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:12,143
- Would anyone from the
audience like to speak on this?

159
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,943
- I do. Yeah.

160
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,713
What's the traffic level for
that street at that area?

161
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,440
- So when the church was
approved back in 1997,

162
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,980
Patrick Street was considered
an arterial collector.

163
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,560
Since then, that
classification has changed

164
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,020
to what we call a local street.

165
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,750
So, right now, there is adequate capacity,

166
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,770
because it's no longer
seen as a major roadway.

167
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,530
So as of right now, there
is adequate capacity

168
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,750
to support this childcare facility,

169
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,090
because it has been, again,

170
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,550
it was no longer deemed as a major,

171
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,400
what we call arterial collector roadway,

172
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,763
even the changes reflected in the FDOT,

173
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:05,010
there's a doing the analysis for this,

174
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:09,240
that it's been changed as of,
I think even back as 2017,

175
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,830
they changed the
classification on that roadway

176
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,850
to a local street.

177
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,210
- Okay. Yeah, because I
know that's a tight street,

178
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,493
and if you get traffic backed up on it,

179
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,043
that's gonna stop a lot of
traffic from going east to west.

180
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,178
My concern is,

181
00:08:26,178 --> 00:08:28,320
is there any cars gonna
be parked on the street

182
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,150
waiting to pick up their kids?

183
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,700
- No, and that's why I'm
gonna bring your attention

184
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,050
to condition number four
that staff included,

185
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,540
that all drop off and pick up

186
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,820
within the drive aisles is prohibited.

187
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,480
So everyone has to park in a parking space

188
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,270
in order to do drop off and pick up.

189
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,400
The parking requirements,

190
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,740
we have different parking
requirements for childcare

191
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,620
that have designated
pickup areas, there is not.

192
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,260
So this is why we actually stated

193
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,940
that all drop off and pickup

194
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,033
has to happen in a parking space.

195
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,470
And the maximum capacity
is also limited to,

196
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,773
again, it's 100, but
they are proposing 75.

197
00:09:11,621 --> 00:09:13,050
- The capacity is 100?

198
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,210
- Well, the parking spaces,

199
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,710
the existing 20 parking
spaces has the ability

200
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,130
to support 100, but they're
proposing less than that,

201
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,363
at 75 students.

202
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,480
- Okay. Thank you.

203
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,150
- Any further comments or questions?

204
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,420
At this time, I'll remind the board

205
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,580
that if you have any
particular communication

206
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,320
you would've signed from
the vote at this time,

207
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,643
and since having heard none of that,

208
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:42,087
is there a motion to approve?

209
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:43,902
- I'll make a motion to approve.

210
00:09:43,902 --> 00:09:45,206
- Second.

211
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:46,617
- Okay. Public comment?

212
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:48,420
- Yeah, I did. Yeah.

213
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,253
- Oh, did you?

214
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:53,069
All in favor?

215
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:53,902
- Aye.
- Aye.

216
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:55,990
- Having heard none,
the motion approves 5B.

217
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:04,890
- Good evening.

218
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,930
For those who didn't meet
me at the last PAB meeting,

219
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:07,950
my name is John Raven,

220
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,490
I'm our newest senior planner
here at the city of Kissimmee.

221
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,200
And what I have tonight for you

222
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,420
is a conditional use with site plan waiver

223
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,420
to establish a retail sales
use at 1220 Dyer Boulevard.

224
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,970
Now, this site as part of the
Kissimmee Industrial Park PUD,

225
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,420
and the specific allowed uses in the PUD

226
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,950
do include wholesale use,

227
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,950
which is one of the proposed
uses by the applicant,

228
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,950
but the applicant's also
seeking a retail sale,

229
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,950
direct retail sales, for
HVAC parts and equipment.

230
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,120
So, it's gonna be wholesale
as well as direct retail.

231
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,010
And while wholesale is covered,

232
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,820
Section 27 does allow for this
board to define other uses

233
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,520
to include any uses that are compatible

234
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,323
with the allowed uses under the PUD.

235
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,790
And at this time, the staff
is recommending approval

236
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,373
with conditions which are
outlined in the report.

237
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,720
- Any questions from the board?

238
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,260
- Yeah so, I asked Brenda ahead of time,

239
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,654
but this parcel is part of

240
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:31,050
one of the previous
actions this board took

241
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,630
to set the future land use,

242
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,280
change the future land use designation

243
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,280
from part of the Vine Street CRA area

244
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,290
to industrial business.

245
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,020
I guess I'm a little confused

246
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,390
how that interacts with this action,

247
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,240
or whether it has any interaction.

248
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,620
- It wouldn't have any effect on it.

249
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,490
The future land use and
the current allowed use

250
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,640
is different because the PUD determines

251
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,530
what the current use is.

252
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,363
- Right.

253
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:06,060
I guess part of why I was
just a little confused is,

254
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,830
yeah, in the clarification,

255
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,510
it was emphasized

256
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:14,280
that the existing Kissimmee
executive PUD zoning district,

257
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,580
which it is a part of, does
permit sort of warehousing,

258
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,670
but in our previous item before,

259
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,160
the justification we
were given by the city

260
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,650
for changing the future
land use designation

261
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,693
was because of warehousing.

262
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,180
I know that there were other parcels

263
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,470
as part of the action that
we took in the last meeting,

264
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,780
but I guess I just...

265
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,270
Okay, maybe a specific question I have is,

266
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,190
now that we've changed the future land use

267
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,930
to industrial business,

268
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,100
is the Kissimmee executive
PUD zoning designation

269
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,290
consistent within that industrial business

270
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,490
future land use designation,

271
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,980
or are we going to need a zoning amendment

272
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,943
in the near future?

273
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,093
- I don't believe that'll be necessary.

274
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:57,926
- Okay.

275
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,833
Okay. Thank you.

276
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:06,467
- Any public comment on this item?

277
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,190
Motion to approve item 5B.

278
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:15,813
- I guess, can we make a motion to approve

279
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:17,820
with the conditions outlined?

280
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,653
Is that?

281
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,203
I'll make a motion to approve

282
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:23,580
with the conditions outlined by the city.

283
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,413
- Thank you.

284
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,149
Second.

285
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:28,661
All in favor?

286
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:29,494
- Aye.

287
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,010
- Having heard no opposed,
we move on to item 5C.

288
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,718
- This is an approval,

289
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:16,920
this is a recommendation of approval

290
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,410
to vacate a portion of right of way

291
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,600
that's known as McLaren Avenue.

292
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,120
The portion that is being
under consideration,

293
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,410
that's gonna be in the red area

294
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,510
that's highlighted on the aerial map.

295
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,630
This portion of McLaren Avenue

296
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,610
was established by a final plat

297
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,360
that was courted on September 1st, 1886.

298
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,780
Within your supporting documentation,

299
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,230
I included a copy of that original plat,

300
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,153
and highlighted, in yellow,

301
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,393
that was highlighted,

302
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:54,240
what portion today that we are considering

303
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,733
to vacate here for that right of way.

304
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,620
It's about 63 feet
wide, and 122 feet long.

305
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,510
The right of way is
between the two parcels

306
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,630
that you see there to the
north at 504 Randolph,

307
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,210
and then there's another
separate parcel to the south

308
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,490
between where Clay Street bends,

309
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,140
there's a separate parcel there.

310
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,910
Both parcels have different,

311
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,840
there we go,

312
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,820
so this is based on
the recorded 1886 plat.

313
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,940
On the upper left-hand
side, highlighted in yellow,

314
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,580
is a portion that we are considering.

315
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,620
If you take this into consideration,

316
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,780
and then you look at the aerial map,

317
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,440
the majority of McLaren,
which runs east to west,

318
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,000
has been developed,

319
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,543
and essentially has been
already vacated already.

320
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,060
So this is a remaining
segment or portion of McLaren

321
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,710
that you see here

322
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,473
that the city is requesting to be vacated.

323
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,637
This section of McLaren

324
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:59,130
does not provide any
vehicular or pedestrian

325
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,843
types of opportunities.

326
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,890
It does not provide any additional access

327
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:08,010
to any other parcels.

328
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:12,150
To the left, immediate left, or the west,

329
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,400
is where the John Young Parkway bridge

330
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,100
starts to ascend.

331
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,810
There is a steep embankment,

332
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,700
if you scroll down a little bit,

333
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,750
you've got some pictures, keep scrolling.

334
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,943
There are some pictures indicating, here,

335
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,370
the right of way.

336
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,250
And in the background, you
see where the embankment

337
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,870
of where John Young
Parkway starts to go up.

338
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,910
So, with that steep incline,

339
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,110
there really isn't any
opportunity at this point,

340
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,600
because of their safety concerns too,

341
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,870
if we were ever to do something like that

342
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,430
with the steep incline,

343
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,310
to have any type of east-west connection,

344
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,310
whether it be vehicular,
or pedestrian, or bicycle.

345
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,910
So, at this point,

346
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,910
with the status of the majority
of the roadway to the right

347
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:10,570
be vacated, and with
the physical impediment,

348
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,180
with the steep incline,

349
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,370
staff is recommending to vacate

350
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,540
this portion of right of way.

351
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,740
And just for laymen,

352
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,050
when we say vacate the right of way,

353
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,840
that means that this is a paper road,

354
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,910
this has not been opened.

355
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,880
It's what? Doing the math, 138 years,

356
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,070
since the plot's been recorded.

357
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,010
So when we vacate that right of way,

358
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,190
that means that it gets split

359
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,220
between the property owners to the north

360
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,620
and the property owner to the south.

361
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,960
It becomes split between,

362
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,720
it vacates the satis of a right of way,

363
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,790
and then it becomes part of the property

364
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,900
to the north and the south,

365
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,983
it's split equally.

366
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,440
So, what we are requesting,

367
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,410
because of the maintenance,
as you can clearly see,

368
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,171
the property owners have
probably been maintaining this,

369
00:17:58,171 --> 00:17:59,514
and even the previous property owners

370
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:01,864
have been maintaining
this for quite some time.

371
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,090
So, with that, we are
recommending approval.

372
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,063
I do want to point out before then,

373
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,560
I was able to get some clarification

374
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,473
regarding your questions
about resurfacing,

375
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,093
and we were able to
find on the resurfacing,

376
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,743
bear with me here,

377
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,949
that it was done, I believe back in 2013,

378
00:18:29,949 --> 00:18:32,763
there was a contract for resurfacing,

379
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,740
a contract for resurfacing for it

380
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,130
that we were able to to figure out

381
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,683
on Clay Street and Randolph.

382
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,080
And then the width,

383
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,254
I think I included on
the response about the,

384
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,780
we were able to do a GIS approximation

385
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,393
of the width using a GIS approximation.

386
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,350
But any other questions
or concerns at this time?

387
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:03,030
We're requesting approval
subject to easements,

388
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,580
because, within your
supporting documentation,

389
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,620
there are some utilities
that were identified

390
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,900
by Toho Water Authority.

391
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,080
Those easements will
provide Toho Water Authority

392
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,730
and the utilities

393
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,797
to maintain the ability to go in there,

394
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:20,700
and to maintain the underground
utilities that are there.

395
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,770
But it's just for that,

396
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,200
it's just to maintain
those types of easements,

397
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,820
no differently than you have,

398
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,150
most properties have utility
easements or what have you,

399
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,790
for the abilities for
those utility companies

400
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,963
to come in and to maintain
those types of infrastructure.

401
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,610
- So, you said it gets
split between the two owners

402
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,870
that are currently there?

403
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,103
- Yes.

404
00:19:44,103 --> 00:19:45,420
- And they're aware? They know that?

405
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,340
That's already been
discussed with them and-

406
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,850
- Part of the city initiation with us

407
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,890
is with the property owners

408
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,070
initially coming to the city with that.

409
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,903
- Okay.

410
00:19:57,903 --> 00:20:00,053
- Because again, it's 138 years.

411
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:02,880
And you can see from the photography

412
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,320
that it's been maintained,

413
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,453
and it's not been by the city.

414
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:09,010
- They're both owner-occupied,
both properties,

415
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:09,843
that we know of?

416
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:12,090
- Well, one property, as
you can see here, is vacant,

417
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,180
so, where the tree is there to Clay,

418
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,150
that is another property
owner to the south,

419
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,753
and then to the north is
going to be the VFW on that.

420
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:25,200
- Any additional questions from the board?

421
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,090
- Yes so, I guess first to declare,

422
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,830
yes, before this meeting I emailed Brenda

423
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,890
for some clarifying questions,

424
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,990
and then also I did a
site visit yesterday,

425
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,210
I biked out to the plot

426
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,950
to get a sense of what it was like,

427
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,500
and how it connected to the many things.

428
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,110
And then in terms of independent research,

429
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,660
when I was there I took a speed gun,

430
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,900
and I measured speeds of
some cars on Clay Street.

431
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,037
And I also took a second,

432
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:53,610
or took a closer look at
our comprehensive plan,

433
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:57,150
and any sections that I
think might be relevant

434
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,310
and pertinent for this issue.

435
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:03,840
So, in all of that, I
do have some concerns.

436
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,010
So, in the sense that I understand
what the city is saying,

437
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,850
this is part of a very old right of way

438
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,490
for what was originally a
planned east-west street

439
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,680
that is no longer, you know, viable,

440
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,903
especially given the grade to John Young.

441
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,640
But then part of what causes me concern

442
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,270
is specifically in the comprehensive plan,

443
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,730
one of our objectives,

444
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,650
let's see if I can get it here,

445
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,130
namely objective 2.2.4,

446
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,740
which tries to ensure that this board

447
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,806
makes sure that we
preserve the right of way

448
00:21:39,806 --> 00:21:42,210
to implement a multimodal
network throughout the city.

449
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:47,210
And specifically in policy 2.2.4.5

450
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,090
encourages us to prioritize,

451
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,130
or sorry, 2.2.4.6,

452
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,280
encourages us to ensure
that we can fill in gaps

453
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,890
to the pedestrian and
bicycle ways in the city.

454
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,020
Now, one thing I noticed
about the proposal

455
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,170
for this agenda item

456
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,440
is that it wasn't mentioned,

457
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,300
and one thing I noticed
when I visited the site

458
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,710
is that there's also a sidewalk

459
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,800
that terminates right at the
north boundary of this parcel.

460
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,750
So there's an incomplete sidewalk

461
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,613
on the south end of Randolph Avenue.

462
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,450
This is, I think, not great.

463
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,920
And then Clay Street itself

464
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,810
also is sort of lacking any pedestrian

465
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,910
or bicycle infrastructure.

466
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,010
Honestly, this is like one of the only,

467
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,020
you know, I don't want to
cross John Young on my bike,

468
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,640
and so I usually go down Clay Street,

469
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,540
but that's kind of scary,

470
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,470
because regularly, you
know, I was sitting there,

471
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,660
I had my speed gun,

472
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,680
and I was measuring cars

473
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,200
at the 15 mile an hour posted speed bump

474
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,900
and they go 50 miles an hour regularly.

475
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,480
So, it's a kind of dangerous place to go.

476
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,970
Now, looking at the
city's comprehensive plan,

477
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,220
in Figure 2.13, the city
outlines the goals that it has

478
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,790
in 2040 for building out

479
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,130
some of our pedestrian
and bike infrastructure.

480
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,560
And there's specifically
like a pixel on the plot

481
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,580
that seems to designate,

482
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,830
it's one of the only
ones in the plan for 2040

483
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,180
for additional sidewalks,

484
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,760
that seems to be located
exactly on this plot.

485
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,600
So one of the things,

486
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,640
I guess the first thing,

487
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,640
how would the city's dedication
in the comprehensive plan

488
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,620
to complete the missing
sidewalk on this plot

489
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,113
be affected by vacating
the total right of way?

490
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,260
Maybe that's the first thing to ask.

491
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,723
- Well, in response, it would not.

492
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,100
Because it's vacated

493
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,810
does not mean there's
not a future opportunity

494
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,400
to construct a sidewalk.

495
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,829
- Does it make it more difficult?

496
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:35,970
- Yes and no.

497
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:40,230
Because if it's within
a capital improvement,

498
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,680
or if it's within a
city priority to do so,

499
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,130
there are mechanisms in
place for a public benefit,

500
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,570
where we can go through a process

501
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,210
where we can acquire additional runway,

502
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,360
or different additional dedication

503
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,910
if we need to accommodate that.

504
00:23:57,995 --> 00:24:00,810
And typically, there's a certain priority,

505
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,670
certain order of things,

506
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,850
where we can acquire that
additional right of way.

507
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,400
- So if I'm hearing you correctly,

508
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,860
it's not as if vacating
the total right of way

509
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:15,450
would preclude future
build out of the sidewalk,

510
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,890
but am I correct in interpreting

511
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,530
that it would create additional
hurdles down the line?

512
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,110
There would be things
that would have to be done

513
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,730
in order to enable that to happen.

514
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,563
- Right, it may,

515
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,920
but no differently right now
within our form base code,

516
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,590
we have a streetscape zone requirement,

517
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,940
and part of it,

518
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,830
which will require part of the sidewalks

519
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,380
will meander between the
existing right of way

520
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,377
and private property too as well.

521
00:24:40,377 --> 00:24:44,250
And with the portion
that within those areas,

522
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,520
we go through an easement
process, what have you.

523
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,490
So, it could become difficult,

524
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,810
but then it could not too,

525
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:55,260
so this vacation does not
say that we can never, ever

526
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,700
have an opportunity to include
or incorporate sidewalks,

527
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,680
not only just along this segment,

528
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,290
but the remaining segment
of Clay Street that's here.

529
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,920
There's the process of
dedicating right of way.

530
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,280
We do community outreach.

531
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,430
In some cases, the property
may come in for redevelopment,

532
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,263
and in that time,

533
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,996
there may be an opportunity
for us to require,

534
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:19,560
and that is a land
development code requirement,

535
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,320
that when they propose development,

536
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,920
then we do require in
front of their property,

537
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,530
they have to provide and
construct the sidewalk.

538
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,900
- And so am I right in
interpreting that, currently,

539
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,880
because it is part of
the city's right of way,

540
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,470
if a sidewalk was gonna be built

541
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,420
to complete the network on this parcel,

542
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,250
that would be the city's responsibility?

543
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,660
And but if the runway's vacated,

544
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,850
and a future developer wanted
to develop on this site,

545
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,790
the other requirements of the MU PUD,

546
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,600
or sorry, the MMTD, the Mixed
Multimodal Transit District,

547
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,180
would require that those future developers

548
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,350
put in a sidewalk or something?

549
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,360
- The land development code

550
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,210
will require the developer
to put in the sidewalk.

551
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,450
- Yeah, I guess part of
what makes me uncomfortable

552
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,050
is it feels a little bit like

553
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,850
the city vacating its
sort of responsibility

554
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:12,483
to complete the sidewalk,
you know, in this area,

555
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:15,540
in the hopes that a
future developer would.

556
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,929
But that's sort of what gives me pause.

557
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:19,879
I mean, would the city be interested in

558
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,080
maybe not vacating the
entire right of way,

559
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,820
but retaining, you know,

560
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,390
a strip adjacent to the
road, much like other roads?

561
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,520
- Right now, it doesn't have...

562
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:37,380
Right now, both 504 Randolph
and that property to the south

563
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,870
has direct access off of Randolph,

564
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:44,250
so it wouldn't suit to where
any type access at this point

565
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,200
for both of those properties,

566
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,540
to even retain any portion of it.

567
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,460
Both properties have access to it,

568
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,220
and we've mentioned, as far as pedestrian,

569
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,590
with John Young Parkway and that bridge,

570
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,260
at this point, what we're saying is that,

571
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,687
there's really no reason to retain,

572
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,070
other than the utilities,

573
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,137
the existing utilities that are there,

574
00:27:06,137 --> 00:27:08,100
'cause we need to continue to protect

575
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,396
those existing utilities within that area.

576
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:14,111
- Yeah, I guess I mean,

577
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:16,830
I can understand that, yeah,
the property of 504 and 515

578
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,800
do have a sidewalk connecting them north.

579
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,070
But if anybody's interested
in going, you know,

580
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,690
east to west across the city,

581
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,670
who doesn't wanna cross John Young,

582
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,877
you do have, the sidewalk
runs out at that point,

583
00:27:29,877 --> 00:27:33,000
and you have to walk on
grass to Clay Street,

584
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and then down Clay Street to
kind of cross under the bridge,

585
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:40,023
which doesn't feel safe.

586
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,203
Yeah so,

587
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,090
I guess, are the city's interests

588
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,240
in vacating the right of way primarily

589
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,240
because the city doesn't see
any utility in maintaining it?

590
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,360
I mean, I guess,

591
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,870
in the justification that
was given in the agenda item,

592
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,210
it seems like the city
was primarily thinking

593
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:09,810
only in terms of connecting
a road to John Young,

594
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,630
which I admit, given the
grade, is an impossibility.

595
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,810
But was the city considering
the impact that it would have

596
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:19,495
on completing the
pedestrian or multimodal,

597
00:28:19,495 --> 00:28:22,500
you know, network in the area?

598
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,323
- Hi, Craig Holland,
Development Services Director.

599
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,550
I am technically the
applicant for this project.

600
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,460
It's a city initiated
right of way vacation.

601
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,077
So, how this came about is,

602
00:28:34,077 --> 00:28:38,010
the VFW leadership came to the city,

603
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,420
the city manager's office,

604
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,420
requesting the right of way be vacated

605
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,323
so they could do an
additional parking lot.

606
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,960
So, and they asked that the city do it

607
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,330
mainly because of the expertise

608
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,630
of a right of way vacation
could be a little complex

609
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,550
for just an average property owner.

610
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:03,990
So, knowing that there was really no way

611
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,860
to utilize that right of way
for access onto John Young,

612
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,633
or to carry a road there,

613
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,580
and then also keeping
in mind the vacation,

614
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,443
if you look at the map,

615
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,473
this one here,

616
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,010
the right of way is vacated flush

617
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,840
with the Randolph right of way,

618
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,970
so any sidewalk on Randolph

619
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:30,090
would be within the Randolph right of way,

620
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:35,090
and not the right of way
that's being vacated.

621
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:41,080
So, the intent was not to,

622
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,840
you know, get away from our responsibility

623
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,223
to put in sidewalks.

624
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,910
And as part of the vacation,

625
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,330
you could make a
recommendation to public works

626
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,630
through staff that they
look at adding a sidewalk

627
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,390
on Randolph from Pennfield down to Clay,

628
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:00,180
and that can be worked into their budget,

629
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,820
'cause they do have a
budget for new sidewalks,

630
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,670
especially in the older part of town.

631
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,253
I hope that answered your question.

632
00:30:07,253 --> 00:30:08,783
- I mean, yeah, I guess so.

633
00:30:08,783 --> 00:30:10,320
I mean, when I was visiting
trying to look at the maps,

634
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,850
I guess it wasn't clear to me,

635
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,820
and the indication seems to be that, yeah,

636
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,270
it runs right up,

637
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,040
like on the satellite map
in the previous picture,

638
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,480
I think you can see that the sidewalk

639
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,903
just north of the parcel
seems to be in the same area

640
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,720
that was designated as
part of the new vacation.

641
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,880
So, I guess like, just overall,

642
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,500
like part of what concerns me is,

643
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,170
I can understand, and I
appreciate, and I agree

644
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,880
that this right of way no longer has

645
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,740
what was the original intended utility

646
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,630
of having a road east-west

647
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,423
that could connect to
or through John Young.

648
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,380
I guess what's still concerning me

649
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,360
is it feels like the city

650
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,170
keeps only seeing the potential
use of this right of way

651
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,990
for an east-west road to allow cars

652
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,760
to connect to John Young,

653
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,740
meanwhile, in the comprehensive plan,

654
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,970
which we have the duty

655
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:01,230
of trying to guide decisions based on,

656
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,840
there was specifically an
indication and a promise

657
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,360
to kind of complete the
sidewalk network here,

658
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,950
I think in concert with

659
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,610
what is proposed multi-use
path along Clay Street

660
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:14,787
that would better enhance
pedestrian mobility in the city.

661
00:31:14,787 --> 00:31:17,160
And I guess my concern
would be that this vacation

662
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,810
is just creating like,

663
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,300
especially a vacation
of the entire parcel,

664
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,850
is creating like more
legal work down the ways

665
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,710
if we were going to,

666
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:29,190
you know if the city was gonna
keep true on those promises.

667
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,151
So.

668
00:31:30,151 --> 00:31:33,540
- I mean, you could recommend approval

669
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:38,540
with a condition that the
easterly line move back 10 feet

670
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,163
to accommodate a future
multi-use path, or 15 feet,

671
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,430
and then, you know, if the VFW,

672
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,390
or the other property owner
felt that wasn't fair,

673
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,280
they could then speak at commission

674
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,440
when the commission
makes the final decision.

675
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,980
So, there's several different
ways to approach this

676
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,750
if you're looking for flexibility

677
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,480
on making sure a sidewalk
or multi-use path

678
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,820
goes down Randolph and
hooks into Clay Street, so.

679
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,780
And I know, right now,

680
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:17,780
the city is working on the
master bike and pedestrian plan

681
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,363
to incorporate that into the comp plan,

682
00:32:22,681 --> 00:32:25,110
and this is one of the
things they look at,

683
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,230
is where there's missing segments

684
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,330
for the transportation network,

685
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,613
specifically bike and pedestrian, so.

686
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:36,420
But if that would push you at ease,

687
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,813
move that easterly line
back 10 or 15 feet,

688
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,760
probably wouldn't impact the
future use of the property

689
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,983
when it goes to either one.

690
00:32:45,983 --> 00:32:47,103
- Okay.

691
00:32:48,687 --> 00:32:50,520
- You said it wouldn't
affect them, so they'd,

692
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,110
Craig, did you say they'd still,

693
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,610
would that affect their
ability to do the parking?

694
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:57,889
- I think he said it
didn't think it would.

695
00:32:57,889 --> 00:32:58,722
- He didn't.

696
00:32:58,722 --> 00:33:00,067
I just wanted to know if that would,

697
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:03,513
the VFW, I wanted to make sure that-

698
00:33:03,513 --> 00:33:06,840
- I believe the VFW is
looking for parking.

699
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,920
- Would that amendment
affect their parking?

700
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,080
- It has not been laid
out, so it's hard to say.

701
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,561
I mean, it shouldn't.

702
00:33:14,561 --> 00:33:15,567
- Okay.

703
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:18,480
- And the other property, frankly,

704
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,680
it's like 1/10th of an acre,

705
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,020
to get anything on there
is gonna be really hard

706
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,200
even when you add another 25 feet,

707
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,600
'cause it's a tiny piece of property.

708
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,180
But it's possible it would
help them develop that

709
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,750
into a small single family
home, or something like that.

710
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,190
But it shouldn't, 10 or 15 feet,

711
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,540
should not impact either
property dramatically.

712
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:40,199
- Any other question?

713
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:43,470
- And I also wanna point out
the other thing to consider,

714
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,660
is that you can also
do it via an easement,

715
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,720
instead of excluding the 10 or 15 feet,

716
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,223
it can also be an easement.

717
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,860
- Okay, you had a question?

718
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,790
- Yeah.

719
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,860
We still maintain the
rights for an easement

720
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,800
on anything that needs to
be done to the property.

721
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,360
Electrical, water.

722
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,740
- That's right, yes, so,

723
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,170
right now, with the analysis,

724
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,540
it was identified that there
were underground utilities

725
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,220
that were identified,

726
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,590
so there have to be utility easements

727
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,800
to retain the existing utilities.

728
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,710
- So, basically, we still
have some control over

729
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,235
what goes under the
ground and how they do it.

730
00:34:18,235 --> 00:34:19,068
- Yes.

731
00:34:19,068 --> 00:34:20,130
But keep in mind,

732
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:23,610
it's for the maintenance
of those utilities.

733
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,080
- Yes. Okay.

734
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,980
- And it's not an overall general
type of, you know, public.

735
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,760
So, these easements are
gonna be very specific

736
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,320
as to what is being granted or laid over

737
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,700
this private property,

738
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:43,200
how, you know, what it's for,
what it's going to maintain.

739
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,420
So I just wanted to clarify,

740
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,830
just because it's an easement

741
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:50,100
doesn't necessarily mean
that it's all-out public.

742
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,870
So it's for specific utilities
for a specific reason,

743
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:58,350
and it will spell out maintenance
types of responsibility.

744
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,330
So, the other option that you also,

745
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:03,090
instead of excluding the 10 and 15,

746
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,890
which was part of the conditions,

747
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:07,133
you can also state that you can have

748
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:12,060
a 10 to 15 foot easement
for a sidewalk too.

749
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,093
That's the other option.

750
00:35:14,093 --> 00:35:16,758
- Are there any amendments to this?

751
00:35:16,758 --> 00:35:19,121
Are there any amendments to it?

752
00:35:19,121 --> 00:35:19,954
- Are there amendments?

753
00:35:19,954 --> 00:35:22,050
- Yeah, and any conditions.

754
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:26,460
- The only condition right now
is that easements must remain

755
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,410
over the vacated portion of right of way,

756
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,020
and must be provided with a final plat,

757
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,640
or by a separate instrument.

758
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,840
There's different mechanisms,

759
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,910
different ways to establish easements,

760
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,283
so we provide that option.

761
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,250
- So, yeah, I guess,

762
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,720
I think it's up to us,

763
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,160
we can make amendments if we want,

764
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,860
we could try to propose, you know,

765
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,813
modifications to the existing thing.

766
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,803
I think that's up for
this body to discuss.

767
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,520
I think I would feel most comfortable

768
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,110
if the city did maintain

769
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,540
the full sort of
transportation right of way,

770
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,230
it feels like that would enable
the most use down the line.

771
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,330
But that could just be sort of,

772
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,490
I think 15 feet to play it safe,

773
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,110
and I think that...

774
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,350
So, I'm going to make a motion.

775
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,183
- Do we have to hear from,

776
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:18,430
I'm sorry, we have to
hear from the public.

777
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,070
- Okay.

778
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,753
- Any comments from the public?

779
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:32,880
- My name is Pat Fisher, I am
a representative of the VFW

780
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,253
in a role.

781
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:39,540
We have been cutting and
maintaining that property

782
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,863
for many years,

783
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:46,700
and just request the right of way be split

784
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,260
between the two properties,

785
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,723
from the north and to the south.

786
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,200
We understand there's
underground utilities

787
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,410
we're willing to maintain it,

788
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:01,800
if there's any trucks or
anything that needs to go on it,

789
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,793
they can go on it.

790
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,494
Thank you.

791
00:37:05,494 --> 00:37:06,438
- Okay.

792
00:37:06,438 --> 00:37:07,798
- I guess, while we have you, sir, sorry.

793
00:37:07,798 --> 00:37:08,631
- Sir.

794
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,540
- Regarding the conversation
we were having about like,

795
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,910
a potential, you know, sidewalk there

796
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,440
to complete the sidewalk,

797
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,170
or to tie into some
potential multi-use path

798
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,209
on Clay Street or something,

799
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:24,567
do you have or do you, do
you feel as though the VFW

800
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:27,754
has a strong opinion on whether there's a,

801
00:37:27,754 --> 00:37:30,243
you know, 10 or a 15 foot?

802
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,729
- Whatever the city wants
to do, we're all for it.

803
00:37:35,729 --> 00:37:37,229
- Okay, thank you.

804
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,260
- Okay.

805
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,093
- Thank you.

806
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,950
- To the board now?

807
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,633
- I'm sorry? I think you were about to-

808
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:47,553
- Yes, I make a motion to approve it.

809
00:37:48,995 --> 00:37:50,570
- Oh, well, I think...

810
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:56,570
- So, yeah, I think the procedure is,

811
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,500
first we should make a
motion to amend the motion

812
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,370
to add a condition that the city maintain,

813
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:09,660
you know, 15 feet of right
of way on the eastern part

814
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,003
of the parcel.

815
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,360
And I guess I will make that motion,

816
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,430
and then, you know,

817
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,350
we'll see if it gets
a second and approval.

818
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,310
- Okay.

819
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:24,090
So, the motion is to have the 15 feet,

820
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:27,209
did you say the easement,
or are you looking at the-

821
00:38:27,209 --> 00:38:28,459
- I mean the...

822
00:38:30,414 --> 00:38:33,210
How about, okay, I would
like to ask the city attorney

823
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,150
whether she sees that
there's a strong distinction

824
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,190
between those before we-

825
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,023
- I'm sorry.

826
00:38:39,023 --> 00:38:40,680
And then we also have that motion made,

827
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,780
so I think we need to
clarify the whole thing,

828
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,980
because he did say that.

829
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:45,910
Okay.

830
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:49,050
- I think from a procedural perspective,

831
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,209
Mr. Rodney started trying
to raise his motion first.

832
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:52,042
- Okay.

833
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:57,630
I just wanna be sure.
- So, with all due respect,

834
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,950
let's work through this,

835
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,160
and then we can get to the second motion.

836
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,283
So, in answering to your question,

837
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,963
I think what you are trying to seek is,

838
00:39:11,296 --> 00:39:14,390
you know, retention of 10 or 15 feet,

839
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,130
you gotta put that in
your motion specifically,

840
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,220
on the north and south side,

841
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,410
retaining for the city,

842
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,620
just not retaining that,

843
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:33,620
as opposed to vacating that whole portion,

844
00:39:33,677 --> 00:39:35,370
I think is what you're asking.

845
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,140
- Yeah, I was imagining, let's say,

846
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,480
15 feet of the eastern most thing,

847
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,000
to not vacate the 15 feet

848
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,590
of what the proposed vacation is

849
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,119
on the eastern side of the thing.

850
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:45,952
- Right.

851
00:39:45,952 --> 00:39:47,703
- I guess my question for you is,

852
00:39:50,156 --> 00:39:53,520
is there a big distinction between,

853
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,230
or do you feel like...

854
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,330
What's the difference between doing that,

855
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,530
making that motion,

856
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,880
and retaining 15 feet of right of way

857
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,360
on the eastern part of the thing,

858
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,360
versus adding a condition

859
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,887
that we specifically
have a sidewalk easement

860
00:40:09,887 --> 00:40:11,970
on the east part of the
property or something?

861
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,472
Is that?

862
00:40:13,472 --> 00:40:17,490
- I mean, if what you're
actually trying to do

863
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:22,490
is create sidewalks, then
I don't see a distinction.

864
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,920
But if you're trying to
retain that right of way

865
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,260
for something else,

866
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,360
which might be a bike path,

867
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,360
or something less specific
than a sidewalk then-

868
00:40:36,325 --> 00:40:37,158
- Okay.

869
00:40:39,129 --> 00:40:39,962
Okay.

870
00:40:40,974 --> 00:40:42,810
Sorry to jump around procedurally,

871
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:46,890
but I think even with
regards to a main motion,

872
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,510
motions to amend take precedence,

873
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,920
and so I'm going to make a motion

874
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,810
to amend the current motion.

875
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,090
The amendment will be, specifically,

876
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:59,090
to retain 15 feet on the
eastern edge of the parcel.

877
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,810
So, to amend the vacation,

878
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:08,810
to remove the easternmost 15-foot strip

879
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,863
adjacent to Randolph Avenue.

880
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,280
- So, here's what I'm hearing.

881
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,600
We would retain the 15,

882
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,612
but then that takes us back to the place

883
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:23,040
where the VFW is maintaining property,

884
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,440
and that belongs to the city,

885
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,210
or the city has to come out
at the cost of doing that.

886
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,298
If I heard correctly, Craig,

887
00:41:29,298 --> 00:41:30,450
you said that we can
just ask for a sidewalk

888
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:34,473
if that's what the issue is,
that we need a sidewalk there.

889
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:45,750
- You can make that
part of the motion too,

890
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,180
you know, say that the
Planning Advisory Board

891
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,640
is recommending the city
installs a sidewalk,

892
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,950
and the planners will pass that on

893
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,633
to Public Works and Engineering.

894
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:56,663
- Okay.

895
00:41:56,663 --> 00:41:58,740
I just, to your point, I think,

896
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,420
you know, what you're saying is valid,

897
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,640
but I think if we're going to say

898
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,410
that we need 15 feet for a sidewalk,

899
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,450
we might as well go ahead and recommend

900
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,007
that a sidewalk be put in.

901
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,740
- Yeah, I'm fine with that,

902
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,300
to retain the right of way,

903
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:17,280
and also make a recommendation
that the city, you know,

904
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,280
looks into how to specifically
make do on the promise

905
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,570
in the comprehensive plan

906
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,210
to complete the sidewalk in this parcel.

907
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,470
- Okay.

908
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,303
- How about that?

909
00:42:32,303 --> 00:42:33,136
- Can we now vote on that,

910
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:36,180
or does anything need
to be clarified further?

911
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,290
That's good? Okay.

912
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,640
So, do we have a second,

913
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,420
to retain the 15 feet on the
eastern side, if I'm correct?

914
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,000
And recommend that a
sidewalk be placed in,

915
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,903
that's the motion.

916
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,240
Do we have a second?

917
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,560
Can I?

918
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,971
I'll second it. (chuckles)

919
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:54,804
- Okay.

920
00:42:55,986 --> 00:42:57,374
- All in favor?

921
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:58,207
- Aye.

922
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,153
- One opposed? Okay.

923
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,197
Motion carries three to one.

924
00:43:08,761 --> 00:43:09,594
Item 5D.

925
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:12,103
- Well, so again,

926
00:43:12,103 --> 00:43:14,640
I think, procedurally, that
was the motion to amend,

927
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,350
now that we've amended the motion,

928
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,183
I think we still have to make,

929
00:43:17,183 --> 00:43:20,280
we have to pass the motion
itself, if I'm not mistaken.

930
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,690
- Do we have to go back and pass it,

931
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,546
or was it passed with the-

932
00:43:23,546 --> 00:43:26,740
- There was a motion made,
seconded, three to one.

933
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,810
- Okay. Yes.

934
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,250
- But was that a motion specifically

935
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,420
to amend the main motion,

936
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,460
or was that a motion to
adopt the main motion

937
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,910
with the amendment.

938
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,510
- Okay, she seconded amending the motion

939
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:40,380
to include the language around
15 feet and the sidewalk,

940
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,293
that was seconded, and that was three one.

941
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,113
- I understand.

942
00:43:45,113 --> 00:43:47,304
- You got the whole thing. We're good.

943
00:43:47,304 --> 00:43:48,722
- Thank you.

944
00:43:48,722 --> 00:43:50,472
- All right, item 5D.

945
00:43:51,638 --> 00:43:55,500
Okay, item 5D is a
recommendation of approval

946
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,550
of a resolution to vacate a portion

947
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,600
of the Mill Slough right of way,

948
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,380
located on the south
side of Mill Slough Road,

949
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,613
in front of 1630 and
1700 Mill Slough Road.

950
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:14,070
This is also a city initiated
vacation abandonment request

951
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:18,633
of the portion, or the
vacated portion, here.

952
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:25,130
Includes right of way that's
in front of the property there

953
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:28,710
on the corner at 1630 Mill Slough Road

954
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,573
and Mill Creek Elementary School.

955
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,690
The areas have been privately maintained

956
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,370
by both property owners.

957
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:38,130
The width of the vacation, as
you can see on the red line,

958
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,360
it kind of meanders there,

959
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,670
it's not very square.

960
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,470
The reason why that it meanders

961
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:46,440
is that the vacation does not include

962
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,453
the existing sidewalks.

963
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:53,940
The right of way exhibit

964
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,100
that we're going to be looking at

965
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:00,243
shows the area in a
little bit more detail.

966
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,690
It's about approximately
1,300 linear feet.

967
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:06,760
This is only the portion
that's in front of the property

968
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,250
at 1630 Mill Slough Road.

969
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,713
And the other page, if we scroll down,

970
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,020
shows the extent that's in
front of Mill Creek Elementary.

971
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,160
Notice the meandering,

972
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,930
because what we are requesting

973
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:24,270
will keep the existing sidewalk

974
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:27,843
within the right of way that
will be maintained by the city.

975
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:33,710
The existing sidewalk is
outside the perimeter fence,

976
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:37,125
portion of the right of
way has the existing fence

977
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:40,023
of the elementary school
and the property owner.

978
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:44,010
There are no objections that were received

979
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:48,420
for the vacation abandonment
by any utility providers.

980
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,450
Again, what this vacation
abandonment will mean

981
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:54,460
is that the portion that's
highlighted in yellow

982
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,580
will be assumed or required by
the property owners in front.

983
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,800
So this portion that you see here,

984
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,810
it's in front of the elementary school,

985
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:07,500
so this portion here will
be to the elementary school.

986
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,360
The portion that's in front
of the property at 1630

987
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:16,380
will be assimilated or
acquired by the property owner

988
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,213
to the front.

989
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:23,360
I do have, as a supplemental,
that you have a printout,

990
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,300
was comments from the school district,

991
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,730
in which the staff also clarified,

992
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,082
there was a little bit of confusion

993
00:46:32,082 --> 00:46:35,190
regarding whether or not
this right of way vacation

994
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,480
would include the sidewalks.

995
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,010
We affirmed that it does not
include the existing sidewalks.

996
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:44,970
The city will again include that sidewalk

997
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:45,870
as part of the right of way,

998
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,563
and the city will continue
to maintain the sidewalk.

999
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,680
At this point in time,

1000
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,110
staff is recommending approval,

1001
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:59,670
subject to, again, any
easements or any utilities

1002
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:04,350
that they may retain
easements within that area.

1003
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:06,900
I'm here to answer any
questions that you may have.

1004
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:11,130
- So, I guess, once again
to start by declaring,

1005
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:14,370
I reached out and asked Brenda
questions ahead of time,

1006
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:17,790
I also made a site visit
to this location yesterday.

1007
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,410
And in terms of independent research,

1008
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:20,543
trying to look at the comprehensive plan

1009
00:47:20,543 --> 00:47:22,290
and see if things might align,

1010
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:26,343
and took some speed measurements
of cars on the street.

1011
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:30,120
One thing I noticed, again,

1012
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,000
sort of absent in the presentation
from the city just now,

1013
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,210
is that while it is clear in the proposal

1014
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:38,700
that the vacation includes

1015
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,600
just the parcel south of the
sidewalk where there is one,

1016
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,790
what was neglected to be mentioned

1017
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:46,740
is that in that right-most segment,

1018
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,270
the kind of jog at the end of the thing,

1019
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:50,130
there is no sidewalk currently,

1020
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:55,130
which leaves the pedestrian
path to the school incomplete

1021
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,133
for the adjacent development.

1022
00:48:00,554 --> 00:48:02,250
So I have a similar set of concerns

1023
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:05,970
as in the previous agenda item,

1024
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:08,430
in that it feels like the city

1025
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:12,227
should have a duty from policy 2.2.4.6

1026
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:16,590
in the comprehensive plan,

1027
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:18,540
Pedestrian Bicycle Way Gap Infill,

1028
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,120
to already has an obligation and a duty

1029
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,070
to try to fill in that missing sidewalk,

1030
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:26,610
and I'm concerned that the
vacation, as currently proposed,

1031
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,133
would make that more difficult, not less.

1032
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:32,010
- Okay.

1033
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,900
So, I'm gonna point your attention

1034
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,450
to the area that he is referring to,

1035
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,170
it's gonna be on the right-hand side,

1036
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:39,930
along the east portion here,

1037
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:44,280
that there is a missing
segment between the driveway

1038
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,280
that you see on the right-hand
side to the end here,

1039
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,900
there's a missing segment.

1040
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,480
Part of that, and you can barely see,

1041
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,400
there's a small little circle.

1042
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,660
Yep. Right there.

1043
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,820
Which is a stormwater inlet.

1044
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:01,100
So, part of the reason why that sidewalk

1045
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:05,070
is not continued is because
there's that storm water inlet

1046
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:06,420
that's protruding,

1047
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:11,130
and that's preventing that connection now.

1048
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:13,824
- I guess I'm surprised, you know,

1049
00:49:13,824 --> 00:49:15,330
going through it yesterday,

1050
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,440
the ground was level,

1051
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,120
it seemed like there was plenty of room

1052
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,123
for a sidewalk to be completed there.

1053
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:27,210
Yeah, it wasn't as if there was a gully,

1054
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:28,500
you know, a culvert, or a gully,

1055
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,303
or anything at that location, so.

1056
00:49:32,294 --> 00:49:33,453
I'm confused by that.

1057
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,070
I guess, more broadly,

1058
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:41,640
why is the city interested in
vacating this right of way?

1059
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,280
What do you think the
benefit is to the city,

1060
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,460
or how is it in keeping
with the comprehensive plan?

1061
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,953
Normally, again, broadly,
in objective 2.2.4,

1062
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:55,740
we are encouraged,

1063
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,920
the comprehensive plan
sets a overall objective

1064
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,650
for the preservation of right
of way throughout the city.

1065
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,870
And then insomuch as the
land development code

1066
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:05,730
has allowances otherwise,

1067
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:08,220
those allowances are for places

1068
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,750
in which vacation of the right of way

1069
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,477
might contribute to infill development.

1070
00:50:12,477 --> 00:50:13,310
- Okay.

1071
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,940
- For a strip like this,
it doesn't seem clear,

1072
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,520
I mean, there's no hope
of any infill developments

1073
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,070
that the city is trying to accomplish.

1074
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,130
- So, really briefly, before
I turn it over to Craig,

1075
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:27,900
those policies and our response
is for prioritized projects,

1076
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,580
so I wanna clarify,

1077
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:32,100
within the objectives,
and with the policies,

1078
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,860
and that was the response to you

1079
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:38,610
in reference to relation to
this vacation abandonment,

1080
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:42,690
is that it's for prioritized projects.

1081
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:46,560
And so, at this time, for this segment,

1082
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,800
that it speaks to prioritized projects.

1083
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,300
The purpose, what have you,

1084
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,473
I'm gonna turn that over to
Craig to clarify to the board.

1085
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,790
- Craig Holland, Development
Services Director,

1086
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:05,070
again, I'm the applicant,

1087
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:09,540
this is since this is the
city initiated abandonment.

1088
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,090
So, how this came about is,

1089
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,400
Judge Miller, who owns the property

1090
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,400
at the southeast corner of
Mills Slough and Denn John,

1091
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,860
he owns several properties there,

1092
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,533
has been maintaining the property.

1093
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:27,333
And if you look at this here,

1094
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,563
his is in the yellow.

1095
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,430
There we go.

1096
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,173
So, his is in the yellow.

1097
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:39,840
So he was asking,

1098
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,130
he's been maintaining the property

1099
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:43,740
from the intersection of
Mill Slough and Denn John,

1100
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,993
all the way back to the
end of his property,

1101
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,330
and he asked,

1102
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:50,950
since he had been maintaining
it for a number of years,

1103
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:53,070
many, many years,

1104
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:56,220
and actually a fence had
been erected on city property

1105
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,380
by Judge Miller,

1106
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,543
that the city abandon that property,

1107
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,153
and give it to him.

1108
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:07,620
So, the city manager agreed.

1109
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,230
As we got into the abandonment,

1110
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:14,130
we realized that the school
district had property also

1111
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:17,040
that goes from where
the yellow and blue B,

1112
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,410
all the way over to where
that lift station is,

1113
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:20,703
where the red dot is.

1114
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,260
So, the right of way
from Mill Slough there

1115
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,240
is exceptionally wide.

1116
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,370
And Mill Slough is not going to be widened

1117
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:34,290
for any additional lanes
or anything like that,

1118
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:37,980
it's already a very wide right of way,

1119
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,720
the lanes are very wide.

1120
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,720
So, the city abandoning this property

1121
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:49,730
would not impact Mills
Slough, the sidewalks,

1122
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,160
or anything like that, Mill
Slough Road or the sidewalks.

1123
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,650
So, that's the reasoning behind it,

1124
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:58,170
is basically, we have two property owners

1125
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:00,120
that have been maintaining the property

1126
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,530
for a very lengthy time.

1127
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:08,520
And again, with the issue with
the sidewalk not connecting,

1128
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,230
as you go to the east side,

1129
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,300
you could make that a recommendation,

1130
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,390
that the city go in, and you know,

1131
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:17,790
connect the sidewalk to further down road,

1132
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:20,220
where there's a sidewalk on Mill Slough,

1133
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,693
closer to Quail Hollow.

1134
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,283
I'm surprised it hasn't come up,

1135
00:53:27,142 --> 00:53:28,992
because that's the main entrance for,

1136
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,000
what's the name of the school on the plat?

1137
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,600
Mill Creek Elementary is off Mill Slough,

1138
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,283
I'm surprised it hasn't come up

1139
00:53:38,283 --> 00:53:40,860
that the kids are not able to connect

1140
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,750
with the sidewalk there already,

1141
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,310
which usually the school
district's pretty good

1142
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:46,499
about mentioning stuff like that to us.

1143
00:53:46,499 --> 00:53:47,460
- But I guess I'll point out,

1144
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,950
both in the agenda
document that I received,

1145
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:52,380
Ryan had a comment in
his engineering thing

1146
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,030
that pointed out the lack of a sidewalk

1147
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,250
on the right side of the property,

1148
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,140
and in the email that we just received

1149
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,190
from the school district,

1150
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:03,363
it seems like they are
showing a, you know, concern,

1151
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:06,639
is the intention to
approve the abandonment

1152
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:07,650
and retain an easement for a sidewalk.

1153
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:09,870
If yes, then students have a
clear path to walk to school,

1154
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,310
we should not have any
additional comments.

1155
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:12,570
So, it seems like they are concerned

1156
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:14,610
about ensuring that we complete the thing.

1157
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:17,580
I mean, again, having walked there,

1158
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,720
there's kind of a clear gap,

1159
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,390
I saw several people cross
illegally across the street,

1160
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:23,880
because there isn't a crosswalk.

1161
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,590
There's only one in the
middle of that block,

1162
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:27,870
there isn't one until
the next intersection,

1163
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:29,970
there's sort of I think a very clear gap

1164
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:33,393
in our pedestrian infrastructure there.

1165
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,560
And I guess, again, I could
understand that the objective is

1166
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,770
that the city has to
prioritize infill things,

1167
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:41,817
but then as this board,

1168
00:54:41,817 --> 00:54:44,220
and our duty to enact and make sure

1169
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,740
that decisions are in keeping
with the comprehensive plan,

1170
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,530
I'm having difficulty seeing
how giving up this right of way

1171
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:53,913
would help the city prioritize
any plan to fix the gap.

1172
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,270
And then if we have an explicit objective

1173
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:58,103
to preserve right of way,

1174
00:54:58,103 --> 00:55:00,360
I feel a duty to preserve right of way.

1175
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,793
So, I'm having difficulty with this one.

1176
00:55:04,015 --> 00:55:04,860
- And I think, just again,

1177
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:08,400
the right of way is
exceptionally wide here.

1178
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,400
If you look at this map
here, they're showing,

1179
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,540
for some reason that right
of way is very, very wide

1180
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,530
in this section.

1181
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:21,240
And that's probably just because

1182
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,760
you have subdivisions to the north,

1183
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,760
and then unplotted land to
the south is why it's so wide.

1184
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:33,450
- And so one thing I want to
point out as a result of that,

1185
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,860
in my site visit,

1186
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,860
the western half of this block,

1187
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,050
because the right of way is so wide,

1188
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:43,380
there is a 25 or so foot gap

1189
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:46,230
between the sidewalk and a
whole bunch of large oak trees

1190
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:48,660
that separate the
sidewalk from the street.

1191
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,880
And so I would let my 4-year-old

1192
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,920
walk on that portion of the sidewalk,

1193
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,020
I feel safe, even though
I was clocking cars

1194
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,813
going down the marked 35
mile an hour street at 50,

1195
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,350
the fact that there's large oak trees,

1196
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:02,940
and the right of way was so wide,

1197
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,890
enabled the city to build a sidewalk

1198
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:07,050
that was well-separated from the road,

1199
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:08,820
and had street trees in between,

1200
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,290
such then I legitimately,

1201
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:11,220
you know, feel safe,

1202
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,610
and I don't feel scared for the kids

1203
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:16,825
on the sort of right
half of this property.

1204
00:56:16,825 --> 00:56:20,190
Where the vacation here
widens, towards the right,

1205
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:23,340
is where the sidewalk no
longer runs behind oak trees,

1206
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:26,190
but runs in front of the oak
trees adjacent to the street,

1207
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:27,660
and it feels a lot less safe

1208
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,540
being four feet from
50 miles an hour cars.

1209
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:33,120
So, that's also kind of
part of the concern I have,

1210
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,760
is now if the city vacates
all of the right of way

1211
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,650
beyond what is the current sidewalk,

1212
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:39,420
I feel like the right half of this block

1213
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,815
has a sidewalk that isn't
well-suited for the kids.

1214
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,820
The right-most portion
has no sidewalk at all.

1215
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:48,660
And how then are we to improve
the safety going forward?

1216
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:49,770
Part of the opportunity

1217
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:52,020
of the exceptionally wide right of way is,

1218
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:55,230
if we aren't concerned
purely with car lanes,

1219
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:59,010
but if we allow ourselves to
think about widening paths

1220
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:01,530
for better bike
infrastructure or something,

1221
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,630
it seems like it presents an opportunity

1222
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,107
to ensure that the kids,

1223
00:57:05,107 --> 00:57:08,970
you know, middle schoolers,
could walk safely to school.

1224
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:11,280
- Given that the sidewalk meanders

1225
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,520
as you move east from Denn John,

1226
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:18,480
I'm guessing the sidewalk
is placed to avoid the trees

1227
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,800
and avoid the roots.

1228
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,240
'Cause not only do you have the trunks,

1229
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,320
but you have the root system,

1230
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,660
and the minute you start putting sidewalks

1231
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,220
over the large roots,

1232
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,833
the sidewalks get popped
up as the roots grow.

1233
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:35,280
I mean, if it would make
you more comfortable,

1234
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,660
you could recommend approval

1235
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:40,860
for the first portion on the west,

1236
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,960
and not recommend approval

1237
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,810
for the portion of the
school district side,

1238
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:49,140
where there is room for improvements

1239
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,510
for sidewalk and safety.

1240
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:54,303
- Yeah, and I guess even with that,

1241
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:56,820
I still have a little bit of difficulty

1242
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,710
in the sense that we have
a very clear objective

1243
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:00,060
to try to preserve the right of way

1244
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,010
specifically to try to improve

1245
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:05,130
the multimodal pedestrian
and bicycle infrastructure

1246
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:06,000
in the city.

1247
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,830
It seems like this would
be a perfect opportunity

1248
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:08,880
to do that,

1249
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,090
that that objective to
preserve the right of way,

1250
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:14,880
it feels like insomuch as
there's another thing to consider

1251
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,440
in the land development code,

1252
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,880
there are sort of clear
justifications that are given

1253
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,820
for when the city might consider
vacating a right of way,

1254
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,980
and those are primarily focused on,

1255
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,500
you know, the possibility
of infill development.

1256
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,120
But that doesn't seem to
be a possibility here.

1257
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,463
So, I guess, again,

1258
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:37,590
like, you know, aside from the situation

1259
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,360
where the current property owners

1260
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,373
are kind of like mowing the grass,

1261
00:58:44,055 --> 00:58:45,510
I don't...

1262
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:49,950
I have a hard time seeing a
justification for the vacation,

1263
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:51,510
and it seems like such a vacation

1264
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:56,220
would only make it harder to improve

1265
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:59,073
on what's currently there.

1266
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,803
That's sort of my piece.

1267
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,810
- Just one comment.

1268
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:15,630
If you put sidewalks in-

1269
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:18,840
- Can you state your name
and address for the record?

1270
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,863
- Pat Fisher.

1271
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,603
My address is blocked.

1272
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,872
If you put sidewalks in

1273
00:59:28,872 --> 00:59:31,196
on the north side of the Mill Slough,

1274
00:59:31,196 --> 00:59:32,880
where this gentleman's talking about,

1275
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,640
then you're gonna have to
add an additional guard

1276
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,620
going back and forth for the children

1277
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,330
to go across the street,

1278
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:46,503
where they already have one
at Denn John and Mill Slough.

1279
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:49,113
- I guess, to clarify,

1280
00:59:51,179 --> 00:59:52,890
I do think there's a crosswalk missing?

1281
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:55,350
But there's a segment of
sidewalk missing entirely

1282
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:56,880
on the rightmost part of this thing,

1283
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:57,840
where there isn't a cross-

1284
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,070
- I know where you're talking about,

1285
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,380
but I'm just saying,
in front of the school,

1286
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:04,740
to that new sidewalk
that you're proposing,

1287
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:07,110
you'll have to put another guard

1288
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:08,580
to walk the children back and forth.

1289
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:10,890
I'm just, just a comment.

1290
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:11,723
- Thank you.

1291
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:20,070
- Hi, my name is Elizabeth Robles,

1292
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:22,650
I'm actually here
representing my grandfather,

1293
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:24,030
Gabriel Santiago.

1294
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:29,030
He actually owns the property
2418 Quail Hollow Court

1295
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,260
that is attached to some of that area

1296
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:34,800
that is being spoken of.

1297
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,103
He purchased this property back in 2002.

1298
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,080
That area where a lot of
sidewalk seems to be missing,

1299
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,080
he's actually been
trying to take ownership

1300
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,563
of that area of land.

1301
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:55,350
So, I'm not sure how
we would go about that

1302
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:56,790
in this proceeding,

1303
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:59,850
just because when he had first realized

1304
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:02,733
that this area was kind of
abandoned and not really,

1305
01:01:04,204 --> 01:01:08,790
you know, having much purpose,
he went ahead to the city,

1306
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,520
and he tried to submit
the appropriate paperwork

1307
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:16,440
to try and take ownership
of this piece of land.

1308
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,480
And so we're here today

1309
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,480
because he actually still wants
to be able to take ownership

1310
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:25,350
of that section of land.

1311
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:29,610
I have a satellite image
of it, if it's needed,

1312
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:32,910
but pretty much, on my
phone, as you can see here,

1313
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:35,817
this is his entire property.

1314
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,890
And this whole area right behind

1315
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:40,650
is pretty much the area that
we're speaking of today,

1316
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:44,430
and he just wants to be able

1317
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:47,793
to kind of essentially
add that to his property,

1318
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:52,980
and be able to kind of
plant fruits, vegetables.

1319
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:56,400
He's retired now, and
it's kind of his pastime,

1320
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,100
so he'd be able to kind of take over

1321
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,930
the maintenance of that property,

1322
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:03,843
and just move that fence line backwards.

1323
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:07,853
- Yeah.

1324
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,030
- So, if you see the image
that they're displaying,

1325
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:18,090
this is the exact area
that we're speaking of.

1326
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:21,030
Where you see that fence line end

1327
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:23,580
is actually where his property line ends.

1328
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:25,590
Essentially what he would want to do

1329
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:28,443
is just move that fence line backwards,

1330
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,343
and take responsibility
for that area of land.

1331
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,883
- Robles. R-O-B-L-E-S.

1332
01:02:48,314 --> 01:02:49,529
- Thank you for your comment.

1333
01:02:49,529 --> 01:02:50,529
- Thank you.

1334
01:02:53,304 --> 01:02:55,680
- Hello, my name is Alana Burkholder,

1335
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,760
I live at 2479 Oak Mill
Drive here in Kissimmee,

1336
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,740
and regarding the vacation,
I just want to know,

1337
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,750
are any of the trees going to be cut,

1338
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,660
or is the road going to be expanded?

1339
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:13,413
I know that he said the road
was not going to be expanded.

1340
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,260
I'm just concerned about the trees.

1341
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:19,863
These trees are over 150
year old, I would assume.

1342
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:25,290
- So, I think we could
ask the city attorney

1343
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:27,270
for clarification, but yeah,

1344
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,890
so my understanding is,
looking at the plan,

1345
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:30,450
because on the right half of the property,

1346
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:32,250
the vacation only goes up to the sidewalk,

1347
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,540
and the trees are beyond that.

1348
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:36,360
Those trees would remain
in the city right of way,

1349
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,910
although I think you're
raising a legitimate question,

1350
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:41,400
because the vacation includes
the land up to the sidewalk,

1351
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,650
and on the right half of this block,

1352
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:45,870
the sidewalk is beyond the trees,

1353
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:47,460
presumably it would be up to

1354
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,260
whoever the property is vacated to,

1355
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,240
in this case, I think the middle school,

1356
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,526
they could cut down those
trees if they wanted to, right?

1357
01:03:53,526 --> 01:03:54,840
It would be their jurisdiction
rather than the cities,

1358
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,673
is that correct?

1359
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,453
- Once vacated.

1360
01:03:59,023 --> 01:04:04,023
- Well, they would still
need to obtain a permit

1361
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:05,340
from the city.

1362
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:08,610
- But it would be, I mean
it becomes an ordinary,

1363
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:11,160
you know, land tree removal
permit or something.

1364
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,380
But they would own the tree at that point,

1365
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:14,580
it wouldn't be the city, right?

1366
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:15,413
- Right.

1367
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,560
But, again, I wanna stress too,

1368
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,010
that the option would be an easement.

1369
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:25,410
You could do an easement, let me finish,

1370
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:26,910
so, the other option

1371
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:29,670
that I wanted to let
the board be aware of,

1372
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:32,790
and to go back to the staff condition,

1373
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:35,670
an easement would mean that the
vacation would move forward,

1374
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:38,131
it would be private property,

1375
01:04:38,131 --> 01:04:41,490
but you can also request
that an easement be retained

1376
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:42,780
on that property.

1377
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:45,450
Now, that easement
would have to be set up,

1378
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:47,160
again, there's different documents,

1379
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:50,640
or there's different ways
to establish an easement,

1380
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,117
but you could also do
an easement too as well.

1381
01:04:54,117 --> 01:04:58,320
And the easement can place
restrictions within that area

1382
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,750
of what can and cannot occur.

1383
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:03,570
For example, again, within
the form-based code area,

1384
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:07,290
we do require easements be
placed on private property

1385
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:10,530
to accommodate sidewalks along
the Vine Street corridor.

1386
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:13,170
Those sidewalks too, when they expand,

1387
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:14,820
portions will be in the right of way,

1388
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,313
and portions of it is on private property.

1389
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,860
So, I wanna also point out
that that would be the case.

1390
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:25,920
And also, I wanna point
out in the background too,

1391
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,140
of the stormwater inlet that's there,

1392
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:30,360
we can include that condition,

1393
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,280
but just know that we
would have to bring it back

1394
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:35,760
if there's a condition to
construct that sidewalk,

1395
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,960
it would still have to go back

1396
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,150
to our Public Works Engineering department

1397
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:40,440
to take a look at,

1398
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,380
to make sure, if the
sidewalk is placed there,

1399
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:46,713
that we can do that, and do
that accurately and correctly,

1400
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:50,400
utilities, or what have you, to do so.

1401
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,770
But is that your pleasure?

1402
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:53,430
Is that the pleasure of the board?

1403
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:57,180
But I wanted to bring
that to your attention

1404
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:00,183
as some of the additional
options in this case.

1405
01:06:05,112 --> 01:06:06,412
- We have another comment.

1406
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:12,360
- Hi, so my name's Melissa Menyel,

1407
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,040
I live on Benjamin Drive.

1408
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,110
So, I just have two concerns.

1409
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:17,280
The first one is-

1410
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,189
- Can you state your
name and address please?

1411
01:06:20,189 --> 01:06:24,333
- Melissa Menyel, I live
on 2422 Benjamin Drive.

1412
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,330
So my first concern is,

1413
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:30,903
I do agree that it would be
nice to have a sidewalk there,

1414
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:32,340
I went to Mill Creek Elementary,

1415
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:33,930
and so I would have to cross

1416
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:36,196
where the crosswalk is currently at.

1417
01:06:36,196 --> 01:06:38,430
If there would be a sidewalk,
like if it would be extended,

1418
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:39,930
and there would be a crosswalk there,

1419
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:42,510
that would've made it more
convenient, at least for me.

1420
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:44,386
So, that would be nice.

1421
01:06:44,386 --> 01:06:47,130
But if this just gonna stay in limbo,

1422
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:49,200
'cause it hasn't been
done at all in this time,

1423
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,450
I think it should just
go back to the people.

1424
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:53,490
Because why just let it linger, right,

1425
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:54,600
when they could be using it

1426
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,180
for whatever they wanna use it for.

1427
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:00,213
And then my second thing would be,

1428
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,030
could the people who
take ownership of that,

1429
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:04,920
could they just use
that land for whatever,

1430
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:08,493
or is there any restrictions,
like what could be done?

1431
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:11,403
Just, that's all I have.

1432
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:15,781
- Thank you.

1433
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:18,773
- Oh, go ahead.

1434
01:07:18,773 --> 01:07:19,606
- Oh, I was just thinking.

1435
01:07:19,606 --> 01:07:21,570
- So, yeah, do you want-

1436
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:22,731
- Yes, please.

1437
01:07:22,731 --> 01:07:25,413
So, the property, the zoning,

1438
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,950
so, the existing property
in whatever zone,

1439
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:32,730
I believe it was RA1 for that
property, or on this portion.

1440
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:34,920
So, whatever zoning
designation that that property,

1441
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,900
adjacent property, would have,

1442
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:40,080
it would determine exactly
what can be built on there.

1443
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:44,700
For example, looks like a
portion of it, Oak Mill,

1444
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,170
that's RA3,

1445
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:50,853
so that portion would be
subject to RA3 zoning standards.

1446
01:07:50,853 --> 01:07:52,530
That would include setbacks,

1447
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:55,620
that would include anything
for accessory structure.

1448
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:58,887
So it'd be subject to
the zoning for setbacks,

1449
01:07:58,887 --> 01:08:00,873
for development, or what have you.

1450
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:05,670
That's what would happen if
this vacation went through.

1451
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:07,680
Same thing in the case of the CF,

1452
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,480
which is Community Facilities,

1453
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:13,260
that's gonna be the
boundary of the school.

1454
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:16,117
So, the school would assume
that section if and when,

1455
01:08:16,117 --> 01:08:18,510
you know, they simply may maintain it,

1456
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:20,353
but if they wanted to do anything else,

1457
01:08:20,353 --> 01:08:21,186
it would be subject

1458
01:08:21,186 --> 01:08:23,100
to the Community Facility zoning setbacks,

1459
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,290
development standards,
the whole nine yards,

1460
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:28,230
and also RA1 one for the property,

1461
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:32,010
in front of the property
here, RA1 standards,

1462
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:34,177
zoning setbacks standards, what have you.

1463
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,083
- Okay.

1464
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:42,693
So, I think, yeah, just
my sort of final thoughts.

1465
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:48,090
Again, I have a really hard
time justifying this one.

1466
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,550
We have a sort of explicit objective

1467
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:53,370
in the comprehensive plan
that we have a duty to uphold

1468
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:54,900
to preserve the right of way,

1469
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,670
to ensure that the city can continue

1470
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,533
to develop multimodal paths.

1471
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:01,800
In this particular case,

1472
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,765
it seems like there isn't any hope of,

1473
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:07,650
or at least on most of the
parcel, infill development.

1474
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:09,660
It feels like part of the reason

1475
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:11,850
is the city has been sort of derelict

1476
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:14,790
in its duty to maintain the property.

1477
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:16,110
I think...

1478
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:21,110
Or I think we should vote
to not approve this item,

1479
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,480
but maybe send a recommendation
to the city commission that,

1480
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,820
one, they ask the city

1481
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:29,583
to look into completing the sidewalk,

1482
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:33,750
more broadly, look into
opportunities the city has

1483
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:38,340
to improve the sidewalk or
bicycle path on the street

1484
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,690
to the middle school,

1485
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:44,690
and potentially even add in a
suggestion that they consider,

1486
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:47,070
you know, vacating a small parcel,

1487
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:49,680
you know, like maybe
the final jog at the end

1488
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:52,206
to an adjacent property owner,

1489
01:09:52,206 --> 01:09:53,940
if they can sort of
better take care of it.

1490
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:58,290
So, I think that's kind of
where I'm at on this one, but.

1491
01:10:00,733 --> 01:10:02,520
- I just wanna clarify,

1492
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,520
on the objectives, it's prioritized,

1493
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,780
let me finish, please.

1494
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:07,613
- Yep.

1495
01:10:07,613 --> 01:10:10,020
- It's prioritized projects,

1496
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:13,800
these plans are planned
out to 2030 and 2040,

1497
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,690
they are projected.

1498
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:19,830
And so, as we move along, no
differently than the exercise

1499
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:20,820
and the community exercise

1500
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,773
that we're doing, Onward Kissimmee,

1501
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:27,510
that those plans, those
exhibits are subject to change,

1502
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:30,270
with additional analysis or what have you.

1503
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:33,900
So, the city has to go through
a prioritization project,

1504
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,960
but those specific
objectives are pertaining

1505
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,820
to prioritized projects.

1506
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:42,693
Some of those objectives also
pertain to new development,

1507
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:46,860
as they move along for
a proposed development.

1508
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:49,080
At this point in time,

1509
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,760
there are not any proposed development.

1510
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,050
But I just wanna be clear
that these are projections,

1511
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:56,460
these are objectives,

1512
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,163
and it's for prioritized projects.

1513
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:04,471
- Is there a motion?

1514
01:11:04,471 --> 01:11:05,702
- There's not a motion.

1515
01:11:05,702 --> 01:11:07,011
- I make a motion to approve.

1516
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:07,844
- As it is, approve?

1517
01:11:07,844 --> 01:11:08,677
- Yep.

1518
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:11,850
- Oh, I'm sorry. We have another comment.

1519
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,413
- Another comment? Okay.

1520
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,350
Keep that in mind.

1521
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:20,970
- Yes, we have a motion on the floor.

1522
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:24,030
I didn't know if anybody
heard the motion that was.

1523
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,260
Yeah. Okay.

1524
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:26,093
- He made a motion to-

1525
01:11:26,093 --> 01:11:26,926
- My name is Jeff Miller,

1526
01:11:26,926 --> 01:11:29,490
I live at 1630 Mill Slough Road,

1527
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:31,170
and that's all I want to talk about,

1528
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:33,360
I don't want to talk
about the school business,

1529
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,253
or that bobtail at the end.

1530
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,397
But that's what I'm here about,

1531
01:11:38,397 --> 01:11:41,670
and I think you'll be interested
in what I can tell you.

1532
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:42,820
I'll just come up here.

1533
01:11:44,562 --> 01:11:48,783
I'm 88 years old, and I'm not
in good health. (chuckles)

1534
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:56,847
- Just say your name and address, please.

1535
01:11:56,847 --> 01:11:58,410
- I'm Judge Jeff Miller,

1536
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:00,970
I was born in Kissimmee, Florida in 1936,

1537
01:12:01,994 --> 01:12:05,250
and I lived at 1630 Mill Slough Road.

1538
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:09,406
I lived there for a half a
century, plus three years,

1539
01:12:09,406 --> 01:12:12,360
I moved there in 1971.

1540
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,650
I put together seven pieces of property

1541
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:18,910
that stretched all the way
from Mill Creek Elementary

1542
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:23,373
to the corner of Denn John
and down Denn John 400 feet.

1543
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:29,219
When I moved out there, there
was no Denn John School,

1544
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:30,873
there was no Mill Creek school,

1545
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:34,710
Mill Slough was a dirt road,

1546
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:37,317
Denn John was almost a dirt road,

1547
01:12:37,317 --> 01:12:39,063
and I lived in the county.

1548
01:12:40,619 --> 01:12:42,963
Now, I was in the county for 50 years,

1549
01:12:44,144 --> 01:12:47,017
they just annexed me in
about three years ago,

1550
01:12:47,925 --> 01:12:50,176
and I didn't fight it.

1551
01:12:50,176 --> 01:12:54,030
I said, you know, I've been an
attorney 55 years in Florida,

1552
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:57,583
and Alabama, and I said,
I don't wanna go to court,

1553
01:12:57,583 --> 01:13:00,750
I just want y'all to leave me alone,

1554
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,450
and let's get it straightened out.

1555
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,290
So, when they sold the property

1556
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:10,743
across the street from Mill Creek,

1557
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,210
then the developer came
to me, and he said,

1558
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:17,560
I'd like to have 30 feet
of the front of yours

1559
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:23,313
to make a boulevard, like Oak Run is.

1560
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,287
And I said, "Well, what
are you giving for it?"

1561
01:13:26,287 --> 01:13:27,600
"Well, I won't give you nothing,

1562
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,967
but I'll make you a nice road."

1563
01:13:30,874 --> 01:13:32,430
I said, "That won't get it."

1564
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:34,777
I said, "I'll trade you."

1565
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:37,530
"No, can't do it."

1566
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:40,830
He said, "Well, I'll cut
those oak trees down."

1567
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:42,601
I said, "They're real oak trees,

1568
01:13:42,601 --> 01:13:45,051
you can do what you want to with them."

1569
01:13:45,051 --> 01:13:46,380
The city found out about it,

1570
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,200
and they said that's not gonna happen.

1571
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,500
So they had him change his engineering,

1572
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,773
so when you come up Mill Slough Road,

1573
01:13:57,153 --> 01:14:00,090
and you get to the
intersection of Denn John,

1574
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:04,800
the road curves, that's
the Jeff Miller curve,

1575
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,550
because I wasn't letting 'em
have my property for nothing,

1576
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:09,873
and I made 'em change it.

1577
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,603
So, we got it all straightened out.

1578
01:14:14,155 --> 01:14:19,137
Well, the only thing that's
serviced by KUA is my house,

1579
01:14:20,145 --> 01:14:22,563
the school is not connected with it.

1580
01:14:23,696 --> 01:14:26,160
The water line goes
underneath the sidewalk

1581
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:30,690
in front of 1630 Mill Slough Road,

1582
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:33,960
and that does not affect anybody.

1583
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:38,190
There's a prescriptive
easement for the utility line,

1584
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:40,113
I don't have any problem with that.

1585
01:14:41,405 --> 01:14:45,150
And all I've been trying to
do is get it straightened out,

1586
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:48,630
the property line, away from the park.

1587
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:51,900
The oak trees is a city park.

1588
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,900
The sidewalk runs

1589
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:58,170
from the corner of Denn John
and Mill Slough to the school,

1590
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:00,060
and then it wraps around from there,

1591
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:03,541
and I'm not familiar with
that other park down here.

1592
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,843
The only thing I'm here
on is 1630 Mill Road.

1593
01:15:08,641 --> 01:15:10,980
I've spent a great deal of time and money

1594
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:14,933
having it all surveyed.
(paper crinkling)

1595
01:15:14,933 --> 01:15:16,953
I got the same material you have.

1596
01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:19,700
So, the only thing I ask y'all to do

1597
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:25,870
is to sever my parcel
from this continuance,

1598
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:27,420
and give me some peace,

1599
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:30,780
I have maintained it for 35 years.

1600
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:32,853
It's all inside of my fence,

1601
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,480
and I just want my property
line straightened out.

1602
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,510
So if you could sever my parcel,

1603
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:42,120
y'all can fight it out about the school

1604
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,380
and the other end there,

1605
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:45,440
but I just don't wanna come back,

1606
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,090
in my lifetime, I'd
like to have it settled.

1607
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:49,620
Thank you very much.

1608
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:50,470
- Thank you, sir.

1609
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:57,580
- So, we do have a motion
on the floor to approve it.

1610
01:16:02,032 --> 01:16:05,506
- Can you repeat the
motion for the record?

1611
01:16:05,506 --> 01:16:07,923
- I make a motion to approve.

1612
01:16:11,392 --> 01:16:12,367
Anything else?

1613
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:14,034
- Is there a second?

1614
01:16:18,297 --> 01:16:19,590
- Okay, no second.

1615
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:20,743
So-

1616
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:22,230
- I just wanna clarify,

1617
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:23,490
his motion is to approve it,

1618
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:26,258
to give the judge the property, correct?

1619
01:16:26,258 --> 01:16:29,865
- No, he's approving the
motion in its entirety

1620
01:16:29,865 --> 01:16:32,615
to approve the entire resolution.

1621
01:16:34,206 --> 01:16:35,039
- Okay.

1622
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:37,524
- I think.

1623
01:16:37,524 --> 01:16:39,399
- Correct, that's why you're...

1624
01:16:39,399 --> 01:16:40,826
Just as it is, you're approving your-

1625
01:16:40,826 --> 01:16:42,220
- Just say that again, I'm sorry.

1626
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:45,240
- Your motion is to approve
it as is the entire thing.

1627
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,073
- The entire 5D, yes.

1628
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:48,180
- Yes.

1629
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:50,600
- To vacate the land
and give him the rights.

1630
01:16:51,653 --> 01:16:52,860
- Okay.

1631
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:54,153
Do we have a second?

1632
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:59,977
- Okay, so hearing no
second, the motion fails.

1633
01:17:00,985 --> 01:17:02,520
Is there another motion?

1634
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,450
- So, I guess,

1635
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:07,050
assuming that now we're kind
of back to general discussion,

1636
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:08,580
I think this wasn't clarified.

1637
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:11,340
So, as the gentleman pointed out,

1638
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:14,523
and in part of the documents,
maybe you can scroll back up,

1639
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:18,990
the vast majority of this
right of way, this vacation,

1640
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:23,990
is north of the fences for
the duration of the thing.

1641
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,520
Is there any portion of this vacation

1642
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,403
that is south of the fence?

1643
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:34,650
I think you need to look
at the previous one.

1644
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,760
This one's on the right side.

1645
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,020
- Yes, if you-

1646
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:38,760
- It's up on there.

1647
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,511
- So, if you scroll, if you zoom in,

1648
01:17:41,511 --> 01:17:43,330
you can actually see the fence.

1649
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:45,240
If we zoom in a little bit here.

1650
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,550
- Yes so, it sounds like the gentleman

1651
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:50,540
is primarily concerned in the
fact that the right of way

1652
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:53,700
on the leftmost portion of this parcel,

1653
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:56,280
you know, there's that
sort of dash dotted line

1654
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:57,960
that marks the fence,

1655
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,570
it seems like there's a small sliver

1656
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:02,730
on the rightmost portion of this parcel

1657
01:18:02,730 --> 01:18:04,590
that is beyond his fence,

1658
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:09,090
and I can understand that
that would be annoying,

1659
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:12,750
and I would be willing
to amend this vacation

1660
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:16,500
to only be that sliver beyond the fence.

1661
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,985
And-

1662
01:18:17,985 --> 01:18:20,703
- Hold on, I wanna clarify here.

1663
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:24,813
That bottom portion that you see there,

1664
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:33,540
that's an overhead power line.

1665
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:35,823
The fence line is on
the north side boundary.

1666
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:43,440
Where it says three foot chain link fence,

1667
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:47,010
so his fence is on that north side there,

1668
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:49,351
where the arrow is,
that's where his fence is.

1669
01:18:49,351 --> 01:18:50,700
- That's where his fence is.

1670
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,800
- That's where his fence is.

1671
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,720
So, the bottom that you see there,

1672
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,130
that's the overhead power line.

1673
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:58,110
So his chain link fence meanders,

1674
01:18:58,110 --> 01:18:59,610
on the left hand side,

1675
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:02,850
it meanders where it shows
the driveway heavy equipment,

1676
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:06,622
it meanders north,
adjacent to the sidewalk,

1677
01:19:06,622 --> 01:19:09,690
and where it says three foot
chainlink fence, runs along.

1678
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:11,250
There we go.
- Yeah.

1679
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,083
- Runs along.

1680
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:14,280
There's a gate, it meanders.

1681
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:17,000
- Can we look at the right portion again?

1682
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:17,850
The part by the school?

1683
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:18,683
- Yeah.

1684
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:23,634
And so if we zoom in a
little bit too as well...

1685
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:27,115
Let's see here.

1686
01:19:27,115 --> 01:19:29,483
This one, there is a symbol,

1687
01:19:29,483 --> 01:19:30,660
if you see it, keep going,

1688
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:32,460
there's like the line in the circle,

1689
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:34,230
that's where the fence line is.

1690
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:36,480
So, to answer your question, yes,

1691
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,790
so there is a portion of that right of way

1692
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:42,030
that's south of the existing
fence line of the school,

1693
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:46,170
so that cinder there shows you
where the school's fence is,

1694
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:49,260
and it's adjacent, immediately
adjacent to the sidewalk.

1695
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,160
- Right.

1696
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,930
- To indicate that's
where the fence line is.

1697
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:54,090
- Yes. Okay.

1698
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:57,240
But then there is basically
the entirety of the portion

1699
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,530
on the right half of this diagram

1700
01:19:58,530 --> 01:19:59,910
is all beyond the fence line,

1701
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:02,160
and includes the portion
of missing sidewalk.

1702
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:04,560
Correct? Okay.

1703
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:09,560
So, I'm gonna make a motion
to amend the current motion

1704
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:20,220
to suggest that we
remove from the vacation

1705
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,620
any of the property
north of the fence line.

1706
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:25,104
So, on this diagram
that looks like there's,

1707
01:20:25,104 --> 01:20:27,630
you know, a little triangle portion

1708
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:29,460
on the left part of the diagram,

1709
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:32,340
that looks like there's very
little on the first diagram,

1710
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:34,594
but basically the whole,

1711
01:20:34,594 --> 01:20:38,370
I think the clear thing to
say for the motion would be,

1712
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:42,653
let's try to amend the motion
to exclude from the vacation.

1713
01:20:42,653 --> 01:20:43,830
- Hold on just a second.

1714
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:44,663
- Go ahead.

1715
01:20:44,663 --> 01:20:46,230
- There is no motion yet.

1716
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:48,663
- Yes, I make a motion to amend.

1717
01:20:48,663 --> 01:20:53,663
- You can make a motion
to approve a portion,

1718
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,780
to not amending anything.

1719
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,635
This is the resolution.

1720
01:20:59,635 --> 01:21:01,323
- True, right.

1721
01:21:04,361 --> 01:21:05,194
Yeah, not to get wonky, right,

1722
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:06,630
but I guess this constituted

1723
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:09,190
in terms of Robert's rules of order,

1724
01:21:09,190 --> 01:21:11,160
or the main motion under
consideration would be 5D.

1725
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,273
Is that right?

1726
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,740
- It would be if there was
a motion to approve it.

1727
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:17,573
- Okay.

1728
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:19,800
- There is no motion to
approve, that failed,

1729
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:24,480
so now you can make a motion
to do what you wanna do.

1730
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,710
- Okay, so I will make a
motion to amend item 5D.

1731
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:29,543
- Yes.

1732
01:21:29,543 --> 01:21:34,150
- To exclude from the
vacation all of the land

1733
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:39,453
north of the chain link fence.

1734
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,900
- Okay, I wanna clarify on this diagram,

1735
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,820
so that way we understand.

1736
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:48,690
So, where we see the asphalt driveway,

1737
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:51,387
so you are including
that asphalt driveway,

1738
01:21:51,387 --> 01:21:55,315
the one, two, and you
see where the fence line,

1739
01:21:55,315 --> 01:21:58,556
the third asphalt driveway,
and it meanders up.

1740
01:21:58,556 --> 01:21:59,893
Yeah, there we go.

1741
01:21:59,893 --> 01:22:01,020
I just wanna clarify,

1742
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:03,420
is this where approximately
that you're amending

1743
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:05,733
to exclude from your approval?

1744
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:08,940
- If I'm reading this right,

1745
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:12,150
there's no line with the dots,

1746
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:13,740
and sort of where the mouse is,

1747
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:15,030
that's where the fence line is.

1748
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:16,350
So, everything north of that,

1749
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:19,530
I'm hoping to exclude from the vacation.

1750
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:22,170
And that fence line, at this point,

1751
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:24,870
right now, the mouse is
beyond the fence line, right?

1752
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:26,520
And if it goes down,
there is the fence line.

1753
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,353
Okay.
- Yep.

1754
01:22:27,353 --> 01:22:28,230
- And as we move to the right,

1755
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:31,257
the fence line is at the edge of the thing

1756
01:22:31,257 --> 01:22:32,490
for the duration of that,

1757
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:35,790
and I would hope to exclude
all of that on the right,

1758
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:37,490
at least in the present amendment.

1759
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:46,560
It feels like this accomplishes
what the original goal was,

1760
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,540
the gentleman who has property

1761
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:51,690
that was part of the right of
way that was beyond his fence

1762
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:53,550
would now have ownership of it.

1763
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:55,590
Middle school would now have
ownership of a small strip

1764
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:57,810
beyond the fence that they could control,

1765
01:22:57,810 --> 01:23:00,240
but the city would retain
all of the property

1766
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,460
north of the fence, which would include,

1767
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:04,800
or it seems like, enable the city,

1768
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,190
to approve or make changes to the,

1769
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:09,180
or give them control of the
oak trees that are there

1770
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:10,080
that are nice,

1771
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,090
give them the ability
to put in a sidewalk,

1772
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:14,853
or improve on the existing infrastructure.

1773
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:21,480
I guess, can I ask the
city if the city's like,

1774
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:22,796
if that's okay about the city,

1775
01:23:22,796 --> 01:23:24,183
how do they feel about it?

1776
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:25,950
- It's a motion-

1777
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:29,016
- Does that mean that
the asphalt driveways

1778
01:23:29,016 --> 01:23:30,266
would belong to the city?

1779
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:33,362
- Yeah, I mean they'd be
part of the right of way.

1780
01:23:33,362 --> 01:23:35,610
- They'd be part of the city's property?

1781
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:36,900
- Part of the right of way.

1782
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,700
Yeah. It's already the city.

1783
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:39,533
- It is already.

1784
01:23:39,533 --> 01:23:40,366
- Yeah.

1785
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:45,930
- So we have a motion, correct?

1786
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:48,420
Okay. Second?

1787
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:49,440
And there's a motion,

1788
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,290
he gave the motion for the
way he described the property,

1789
01:23:52,290 --> 01:23:53,123
that's what's on the table.

1790
01:23:53,123 --> 01:23:54,300
So, do we have a second?

1791
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:57,873
We have a second.

1792
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,160
All in favor?

1793
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:02,993
- Aye.

1794
01:24:05,315 --> 01:24:06,148
- No.

1795
01:24:07,017 --> 01:24:10,560
- I'm gonna say no also, 'cause
I'm just not clear on if...

1796
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,590
I feel, may I speak, or do we have to...

1797
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:16,250
Okay, so I wanna make sure
that I understand correctly.

1798
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:18,990
I think that I wanna ensure,

1799
01:24:18,990 --> 01:24:21,240
and I know that he kind of
described it at the end,

1800
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,760
you know, that we leave here,

1801
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,740
because I hear everything
you're saying about,

1802
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:27,400
you know, about what
our job is, as a board,

1803
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:30,810
but I think we have a
superseding job as a board

1804
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:32,040
to ensure that we're working always

1805
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,720
in the best interest of our community

1806
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,274
as it relates to within the confines

1807
01:24:36,274 --> 01:24:38,490
of the description of
what we do as a board.

1808
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,830
So, for me, when I hear,

1809
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:42,930
you know, the judge that
he's been taking care of it

1810
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:45,060
for so long, and he is
willing to continue,

1811
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:46,200
and I hear, you know,

1812
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,450
that you do wanna preserve the oak trees,

1813
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:50,910
and that's important, and
that we need a sidewalk,

1814
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:53,640
I wanna be sure that,
before we pass anything,

1815
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,730
that we are ensuring that
those things are in place,

1816
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:57,270
or at the very least we've
done our due diligence

1817
01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:59,520
to ensure that we are trying to do that.

1818
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,230
So, again, with his description

1819
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:04,860
of where those lines are drawn,
are those things in place?

1820
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:08,193
Does it allow the judge
to get the property,

1821
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:11,747
and I'm sorry I'm referring
you to you as judge, (chuckles)

1822
01:25:11,747 --> 01:25:12,580
that's the part that's retained,

1823
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:15,270
and the oak trees, and also the sidewalk.

1824
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:18,090
I know that we can recommend
as part of it, the sidewalk,

1825
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:19,770
so I know that that can be placed in.

1826
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:21,930
But I just wanna ensure that, you know,

1827
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:23,550
and again, in thinking about,

1828
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:26,038
you know, best use of city dollars,

1829
01:25:26,038 --> 01:25:29,790
are we maintaining property
that we can otherwise,

1830
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:31,591
you know, again, being fair,

1831
01:25:31,591 --> 01:25:33,293
and doing our due
diligence to look at this

1832
01:25:33,293 --> 01:25:35,670
from all different purviews,

1833
01:25:35,670 --> 01:25:37,680
to allow somebody who's been
taking care of a property

1834
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:38,740
for so long

1835
01:25:39,928 --> 01:25:42,840
now continue, as the owner,
to maintain that property,

1836
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,130
versus saying, you know,

1837
01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:47,010
okay, we're gonna retain
it, and be unjust to him,

1838
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:49,530
and at the same time, incur
more costs for the city.

1839
01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:51,660
We're at a time right now,
it's very hard to retain,

1840
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:53,190
and I'm sorry I don't
mean to get on a tangent,

1841
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:57,805
but it's very hard to retain
good employees in our city,

1842
01:25:57,805 --> 01:25:59,430
and we have a high turnover
rate, especially in these areas,

1843
01:25:59,430 --> 01:26:01,530
because they're being
pulled away by hotels

1844
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:02,820
that can pay more, and what have you.

1845
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:04,860
So can't put more burden on our staff

1846
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,480
because we just wanna maintain something

1847
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,820
because of the possibility
that, in 30 years,

1848
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:10,080
it may be something.

1849
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,630
So, again, looking at this
from all those aspects,

1850
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:13,867
I'd love to be able to leave here,

1851
01:26:13,867 --> 01:26:15,750
you know, at least trying my best

1852
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:18,570
to ensure that that we've
looked at all of that.

1853
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:20,640
So, again, in looking at this,

1854
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,593
would those things be accomplished?

1855
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,773
- Can I clarify something?

1856
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:32,030
We just took three driveways
away from the owner,

1857
01:26:33,023 --> 01:26:35,913
half of this is not their driveway.

1858
01:26:37,552 --> 01:26:38,640
What do you wanna do?

1859
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:39,480
- So, sorry,

1860
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:40,740
so, right now,

1861
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:42,977
this is already part of
the city's right of way.

1862
01:26:42,977 --> 01:26:45,000
All of the thing under consideration,

1863
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,250
everything north of this yellow portion,

1864
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:50,100
is already part of the right
of way for Mill Slough Road,

1865
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:52,339
so this was land that the city,

1866
01:26:52,339 --> 01:26:54,570
I mean, correct me if I'm
wrong, but, originally reserved,

1867
01:26:54,570 --> 01:26:56,640
because they wanted to build a road here,

1868
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:58,710
and they maintained kind of full rights

1869
01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:02,220
to develop all of the
land within this wide,

1870
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:03,240
as Craig said, you know,

1871
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:05,940
a wide right of way around the road.

1872
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:09,990
And it sounds like there
was kind of a mistake,

1873
01:27:09,990 --> 01:27:11,730
or an oversight that
was made at some point,

1874
01:27:11,730 --> 01:27:13,300
where that right of way,

1875
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:14,897
you know, I think they do these just,

1876
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:16,380
you know, a 50 feet or whatever,

1877
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:17,850
and it sounds like that includes

1878
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:21,120
a sliver of the gentleman's
property beyond his fence,

1879
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,412
which it sounds like the city,

1880
01:27:22,412 --> 01:27:24,270
according to his story,
erected originally.

1881
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:25,410
So it was, you know,

1882
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:28,290
they erected the fence within
their own right of way.

1883
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:30,150
You know? Sounds like that was a mistake.

1884
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:31,260
And it sounds like, originally,

1885
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:33,210
the gentleman wanted
to correct the mistake

1886
01:27:33,210 --> 01:27:34,740
and ensure that everything
beyond the fence

1887
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:35,910
was his property.

1888
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:38,310
I think my impression is the city,

1889
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:39,570
you know, listened to the gentleman,

1890
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:41,130
took this into consideration,

1891
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:42,390
and brought before us a motion

1892
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,640
to kind of vacate the entire right of way

1893
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,370
for everything south of the sidewalk.

1894
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:48,630
And my concern was that

1895
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:51,270
it feels like that's too much vacation,

1896
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:56,270
and that would make it harder
for the city to address

1897
01:27:56,850 --> 01:28:01,200
what is a gap in the
pedestrian infrastructure,

1898
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,300
which feels particularly troublesome

1899
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:05,640
because this is a middle school.

1900
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:08,340
And so that's the kind
of nature of my concerns.

1901
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:10,920
I was hoping to meet in the middle,

1902
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:13,260
in the sense that I hear
that there are concerns,

1903
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:14,940
and I guess it was clarified for me

1904
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:16,650
exactly where the fence line was,

1905
01:28:16,650 --> 01:28:18,660
and I am totally like, on board with,

1906
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:20,550
even though, you know,

1907
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:22,380
my understanding is that
we have an objective

1908
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:23,813
to preserve the right of way,

1909
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:28,500
this is in keeping with
the comprehensive plan.

1910
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,300
If there is land beyond a fence line

1911
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,097
that isn't serving the city well,

1912
01:28:32,097 --> 01:28:35,460
and it won't be useful for
future pedestrian pathways.

1913
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:40,380
- So maintaining this will now
be the city's responsibility?

1914
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:41,670
- Everything in yellow right now,

1915
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:43,770
and everything north of
that on this diagram.

1916
01:28:43,770 --> 01:28:47,430
- He has no responsibility to
maintain and take care of it?

1917
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:49,498
- It's all the city's responsibility.

1918
01:28:49,498 --> 01:28:50,639
The city owns all of those.

1919
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:51,722
- Okay. Okay.

1920
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,260
- If I can clarify something
with driveway aprons?

1921
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:56,232
- Yeah.

1922
01:28:56,232 --> 01:28:57,065
- The driveway apron

1923
01:28:57,065 --> 01:29:00,000
is always the responsibility
of the property owner

1924
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,600
who is entering their property
from that right of way.

1925
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:06,660
So anytime you add a driveway
apron onto city right of way,

1926
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:09,930
you get a what's called a right
of way utilization permit,

1927
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:13,410
and that basically says you
can have your driveway apron

1928
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:14,397
on city right of way,

1929
01:29:14,397 --> 01:29:18,120
but you are always
responsible to maintain that.

1930
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:21,090
So, at your house, you
probably don't realize it,

1931
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:23,700
but where your driveway
hooks into the street,

1932
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:27,507
probably three feet of that
is actually on city property,

1933
01:29:27,507 --> 01:29:30,630
and your grass is on city
property, a portion of your grass.

1934
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:33,153
You are responsible to maintain that,

1935
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:37,530
so if your driveway apron were cracking,

1936
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:38,670
you would have to fix that.

1937
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:41,040
So, we're not taking
away anybody's driveway,

1938
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:45,090
the current driveways
are owned and maintained

1939
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:47,670
by the property owners
that access their property

1940
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:48,720
off the right of way there,

1941
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,700
so nothing is changing with that.

1942
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:53,100
We're not taking away anybody's access,

1943
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:55,800
we're not taking aways anybody's driveway.

1944
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:56,633
Okay?

1945
01:29:56,633 --> 01:29:57,466
- Okay.
- Okay.

1946
01:29:57,466 --> 01:29:58,300
Thank you, Craig.

1947
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:06,090
- This is my neighborhood,

1948
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:08,100
and I know this neighborhood very well,

1949
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:10,863
I lived here for 25 years.

1950
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:16,580
That is why I am in favor
of meeting in the middle,

1951
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:20,460
because I do see the need

1952
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:22,760
from living in this
neighborhood for 25 years,

1953
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,800
and not having the sidewalk.

1954
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,263
I do, I would like to,

1955
01:30:27,263 --> 01:30:30,150
and I'm in favor of preserving, you know,

1956
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:34,143
a future for a possible
driveway, I mean sidewalk,

1957
01:30:35,610 --> 01:30:38,310
because there's a lot of
kids walking around there.

1958
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:41,910
And, as a citizen of Kissimmee,

1959
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:46,910
I will feel also safer
having a sidewalk there,

1960
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:51,347
but then also giving back
to the judge some of it, so.

1961
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,589
- So, right now,

1962
01:30:55,589 --> 01:30:58,830
we have a motion that was made with the-

1963
01:30:58,830 --> 01:30:59,663
- It's two two.

1964
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:06,560
Right so, we can raise another motion?

1965
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:08,850
- Yeah, I forget, procedurally,

1966
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:10,710
whether we can reraise
the existing motion,

1967
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:13,080
or how many times we can do that.

1968
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,106
- You can-

1969
01:31:14,106 --> 01:31:14,939
- If we're allowed to do that,

1970
01:31:14,939 --> 01:31:15,888
I would like to do that again.

1971
01:31:15,888 --> 01:31:18,388
- You can rephrase it in a way

1972
01:31:19,336 --> 01:31:23,280
that addresses some of the concerns raised

1973
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:26,300
so that it's more understandable.

1974
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:27,133
- So, how about,

1975
01:31:27,133 --> 01:31:29,850
in light of some of the
clarifications we just received

1976
01:31:29,850 --> 01:31:31,080
from the city,

1977
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:34,470
and after further discussion
on behalf of the board,

1978
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:38,660
I would like to make a motion
to amend agenda item 5D

1979
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:44,190
to modify the right of way vacation

1980
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:47,610
to exclude all of the property north

1981
01:31:47,610 --> 01:31:49,863
of the existing chain link fence.

1982
01:31:54,664 --> 01:31:55,967
I think that is my,

1983
01:31:55,967 --> 01:31:56,910
there we go.

1984
01:31:56,910 --> 01:31:58,770
- I think that was the same
as the previous motion.

1985
01:31:58,770 --> 01:32:00,150
- I was hoping that,

1986
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:03,720
in saying that we, in pointing out

1987
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:06,030
that we had further
discussion and clarification

1988
01:32:06,030 --> 01:32:10,290
that the situation was
materially different, but-

1989
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,250
- All right, do we have a second?

1990
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,130
- You're seconding it?

1991
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:18,090
Okay.

1992
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:19,350
All in favor?

1993
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:20,749
- Aye.

1994
01:32:20,749 --> 01:32:21,582
- Aye.

1995
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,440
One opposed, three to one, it passes.

1996
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,273
- Okay.

1997
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:29,790
So then, again, not to be wonky,

1998
01:32:29,790 --> 01:32:31,380
but to make sure we do this right,

1999
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:32,213
did I just,

2000
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:35,160
I made an a motion to
amend the agenda item,

2001
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:38,583
do we now need a second motion
to adopt the amended item?

2002
01:32:46,290 --> 01:32:47,690
But I, like-

2003
01:32:47,690 --> 01:32:52,050
- The second motion did pass.

2004
01:32:52,050 --> 01:32:55,353
So, it was a motion to
amend the agenda item,

2005
01:32:56,340 --> 01:33:00,060
now they approve that amendment,

2006
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:04,533
and now they want to
approve it, as amended.

2007
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,550
So now you have to raise motion

2008
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:12,690
to approve the amended agenda item.

2009
01:33:12,690 --> 01:33:14,250
- My understanding is, with Robert rules,

2010
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:15,630
you have to make the amendment,

2011
01:33:15,630 --> 01:33:16,740
we have to pass the amendment,

2012
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:17,820
once the amendment is passed,

2013
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:18,690
now it's in the state

2014
01:33:18,690 --> 01:33:20,700
where it is now an amended agenda item,

2015
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:21,930
so now I'm gonna make the motion

2016
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:25,415
that we approve the amended agenda item.

2017
01:33:25,415 --> 01:33:26,975
- Second.

2018
01:33:26,975 --> 01:33:28,652
All in favor?

2019
01:33:28,652 --> 01:33:29,652
- Aye.
- Aye.

2020
01:33:30,813 --> 01:33:33,980
One opposed, three to one, it carries.

2021
01:33:35,764 --> 01:33:38,514
Item number six, public hearings.

2022
01:33:39,952 --> 01:33:40,785
We have none.

2023
01:33:40,785 --> 01:33:42,900
Item number seven, any discussion?

2024
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:46,470
- Yes so, I have some general discussion.

2025
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:50,310
So, I mean, just because it,

2026
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:52,533
maybe because it came up several times,

2027
01:33:53,730 --> 01:33:55,320
I think it might be germane

2028
01:33:55,320 --> 01:34:00,320
to read the part of the city code,

2029
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,263
sorry, if I can find it.

2030
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:15,510
So, Objective 2.2.4,
Preservation of Right of Way

2031
01:34:15,510 --> 01:34:17,280
to Implement Multimodal Network.

2032
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,050
The city of Kissimmee shall continue

2033
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:21,240
to protect existing and
future right of way needs

2034
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,010
by requiring all proposed developments

2035
01:34:23,010 --> 01:34:24,480
to preserve or dedicate right of way

2036
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,430
to maintain an
interconnected roadway system

2037
01:34:26,430 --> 01:34:28,440
from multiple modes of transportation.

2038
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:30,720
Just because we talked
about it several times,

2039
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:31,553
as part of the record,

2040
01:34:31,553 --> 01:34:33,360
I wanted to kind of put that out there.

2041
01:34:34,230 --> 01:34:36,690
In terms of other discussion items,

2042
01:34:36,690 --> 01:34:38,970
one thing I wanted to ask,

2043
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:41,400
so Onward Kissimmee just started,

2044
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:46,287
which seems to be part of
the city's plan for the EAR,

2045
01:34:46,287 --> 01:34:49,110
the updates to the comprehensive plan.

2046
01:34:49,110 --> 01:34:51,570
I was wondering, as the
planning advisory board,

2047
01:34:51,570 --> 01:34:54,900
who have the duty, obligation,

2048
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:58,320
and responsibility under the city code to,

2049
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:01,740
you know, maintain and approve
the comprehensive plan,

2050
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:05,100
whether there were plans for
us to meet therefore for us,

2051
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:06,600
to see if we could set up a workshop

2052
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:11,310
with the team responsible
running Onward Kissimmee,

2053
01:35:11,310 --> 01:35:15,240
to receive sort of updates
or further information

2054
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:16,560
about the effort.

2055
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:19,980
- Okay, so that is a
separate consulting contract

2056
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:21,210
that the city has entered

2057
01:35:21,210 --> 01:35:23,730
within the consultant that's facilitating

2058
01:35:23,730 --> 01:35:25,890
those community facility workshops.

2059
01:35:25,890 --> 01:35:28,440
Am I understanding the
outcome of this workshop

2060
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:31,473
is to have plans or documents?

2061
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:34,920
So, under the current contract right now,

2062
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,950
it only includes the community outreach

2063
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:40,560
and the development of
the documents and plans,

2064
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,570
so I can check with our
long-range planning,

2065
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:45,450
but that's the scope of
the contract that they have

2066
01:35:45,450 --> 01:35:47,730
to facilitate the community meetings,

2067
01:35:47,730 --> 01:35:51,780
and then also to have
the documents or plans.

2068
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:55,527
I think part of it is the bike pad plan,

2069
01:35:55,527 --> 01:35:58,440
and part of it is could
be suggestions, comments,

2070
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:01,260
to support upcoming changes
in the transportation

2071
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:03,064
and future land use element.

2072
01:36:03,064 --> 01:36:06,810
But that does not include
any other types of workshops

2073
01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:09,666
or education to the
planning advisory board.

2074
01:36:09,666 --> 01:36:11,010
Not part of the scope.

2075
01:36:11,010 --> 01:36:14,970
- Do we have to go back to amend that?

2076
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:17,760
- But, in keeping, we've
had several conversations

2077
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,950
about having an upcoming workshop,

2078
01:36:19,950 --> 01:36:22,080
I think part of the reasons
why that we postponed it,

2079
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,750
because to allow for the addition

2080
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:27,600
of new Planning Advisory Board members

2081
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,150
to be appointed to the board

2082
01:36:30,150 --> 01:36:32,940
before we can start to
schedule a workshop.

2083
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:34,290
We had already mentioned internally,

2084
01:36:34,290 --> 01:36:36,696
there'll be a two-part workshop,

2085
01:36:36,696 --> 01:36:40,110
one will be on laws,
ethics, Robert's rule,

2086
01:36:40,110 --> 01:36:43,315
and the other would be
the comprehensive plan

2087
01:36:43,315 --> 01:36:45,960
and the land development code.

2088
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,100
I can tell you right now

2089
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:50,400
that there is a potential,
not 100% confirmed,

2090
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:53,730
that we have an agenda
item for September 3rd,

2091
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:55,350
and we had previously mentioned that,

2092
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:57,750
in order to allow for
the utmost amount of time

2093
01:36:57,750 --> 01:36:58,740
for the workshop,

2094
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:01,080
that we would have to schedule a workshop

2095
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:04,113
on a date that we don't
have any agenda items.

2096
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:08,100
So, right now, that we're looking at,

2097
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:10,860
at the earliest, would be late September.

2098
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:13,530
And then also, it's also
subject to us having a quorum.

2099
01:37:13,530 --> 01:37:15,780
So, I cannot stress again,

2100
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:18,240
when emails are sent
out, to please respond,

2101
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:22,641
so that way we can confirm
that we will have enough folks

2102
01:37:22,641 --> 01:37:23,591
to have a workshop.

2103
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:26,310
But that's the answer to your question,

2104
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:29,730
it's not part of the contract
now for the consultants.

2105
01:37:29,730 --> 01:37:30,563
- Yeah, thank you.

2106
01:37:30,563 --> 01:37:33,240
I guess, just as like a technical thing,

2107
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:36,060
is the quorum simply a
requirement for voting?

2108
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:38,520
I mean, would we be potentially
allowed to have a work...

2109
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,020
No, we need to have a quorum for anything.

2110
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,190
Okay. Just clarification.

2111
01:37:41,190 --> 01:37:42,190
Thank you very much.

2112
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:44,280
Okay so, thank you.

2113
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,173
I guess I just wanted to, you know,

2114
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:49,680
because of our duties in the city charter,

2115
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:52,283
in Section 2.2.12,

2116
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:54,060
for the authority to prepare
the comprehensive plan,

2117
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:55,860
and in section 2-213

2118
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:57,720
for the responsibility
of monitoring the plan

2119
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:00,540
upon adoption of the comprehensive plan,

2120
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:03,217
I feel a duty and an obligation to be,

2121
01:38:03,217 --> 01:38:04,800
you know, sort of,

2122
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,170
I think this board should be a participant

2123
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:09,780
in part of the Onward Kissimmee things,

2124
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:11,250
and I guess I can understand

2125
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:13,740
if the current contract
with the consultants

2126
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:15,480
doesn't include additional meetings,

2127
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:17,310
but I guess just,

2128
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:19,260
I just wanted to emphasize
and invite the city

2129
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:22,830
to invite the PAB as
to part of the process,

2130
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:25,170
because I think it is part of our duties

2131
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:26,523
and our responsibilities.

2132
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:31,050
Sorry, so I think we're
still in the business,

2133
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:32,280
one thing I wanted to...

2134
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:34,920
So, part of what we discussed last time,

2135
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:38,010
I think we could make a motion

2136
01:38:38,010 --> 01:38:41,250
to recommend that the city commission

2137
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:44,310
look into completing the sidewalk,

2138
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:47,190
both on the Randolph Street property

2139
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:49,920
and the Mills Slough Street property.

2140
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,800
And I think that's something
within our power to do,

2141
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:53,880
is to make a motion to
make that recommendation

2142
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,680
to the city commission.

2143
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,400
I would like to make that motion now.

2144
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:00,240
So, I make a motion that we recommend

2145
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:04,590
that the city commission look
into completing the sidewalk

2146
01:39:04,590 --> 01:39:07,170
on the Randolph Street property,

2147
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:10,140
as well as the Mill Street property

2148
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:11,513
in front of the middle school.

2149
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:14,639
- Do I have a second?

2150
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:15,722
Okay. All in favor?

2151
01:39:15,722 --> 01:39:16,555
- Aye.

2152
01:39:16,555 --> 01:39:17,388
- Aye.

2153
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:23,040
Motion carries, four to one,

2154
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,040
four to none, sorry.

2155
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:28,890
Okay.

2156
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:31,110
And then board members here,

2157
01:39:31,110 --> 01:39:32,280
I think we've already covered that.

2158
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:34,173
And I have a motion to adjourn.

2159
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:36,581
- Motion to adjourn.

2160
01:39:36,581 --> 01:39:40,081
(person speaking faintly)

2161
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:45,690
- He said that he'd like to know,

2162
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:47,580
if that they realize they
don't need a sidewalk.

2163
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:48,990
You wanna?

2164
01:39:48,990 --> 01:39:52,650
- I'd like to know, if we
do a survey, theoretically,

2165
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:56,910
and find out that we
really require a sidewalk,

2166
01:39:56,910 --> 01:39:59,740
do we give the right
way back to the people,

2167
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:02,613
or we just let that sit there?

2168
01:40:05,310 --> 01:40:06,960
- At this point, the motion's been made

2169
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,110
to exclude any portion that's
north of the fence line.

2170
01:40:10,110 --> 01:40:11,340
- On my agenda it said

2171
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:13,651
that we're dealing with the right of way,

2172
01:40:13,651 --> 01:40:15,450
we're not dealing with
sidewalks, or trees,

2173
01:40:15,450 --> 01:40:17,220
or anything else.

2174
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:20,761
So, does the land go back to the people?

2175
01:40:20,761 --> 01:40:22,561
Or the city keeps it?

2176
01:40:22,561 --> 01:40:24,990
Or what happens?

2177
01:40:24,990 --> 01:40:25,890
- So, I think there's two things.

2178
01:40:25,890 --> 01:40:30,450
Like, so we made a motion
to amend these agenda items

2179
01:40:30,450 --> 01:40:31,283
to include these-

2180
01:40:31,283 --> 01:40:32,116
- That's not what I'm talking about.

2181
01:40:32,116 --> 01:40:32,949
- No, I know.

2182
01:40:32,949 --> 01:40:33,810
So I think the way to phrase it,

2183
01:40:33,810 --> 01:40:35,700
just for Brenda, is to say that we-

2184
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:37,290
- No, let, let me, let me,

2185
01:40:37,290 --> 01:40:39,150
you don't need to speak for me, please.

2186
01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:41,730
- So the right of way right now

2187
01:40:41,730 --> 01:40:43,380
typically includes the sidewalk,

2188
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:45,480
so the motion that was made right now,

2189
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:49,650
with the portion that was
of concern, was not part of,

2190
01:40:49,650 --> 01:40:51,750
it will remain part of the city,

2191
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:54,457
and will remain part of the right of way,

2192
01:40:54,457 --> 01:40:57,390
and remain part of the city's,

2193
01:40:57,390 --> 01:41:00,421
the area that has the
sidewalk that's missing.

2194
01:41:00,421 --> 01:41:01,521
- Okay, so it'll stay,

2195
01:41:02,670 --> 01:41:05,100
whether or not, or whether it is,

2196
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:06,690
it'll stay part of the city either way?

2197
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:07,950
- It'll stay part of the city.

2198
01:41:07,950 --> 01:41:10,650
And then a motion, a
recommendation was made,

2199
01:41:10,650 --> 01:41:12,930
to bring the concerns
for the construction,

2200
01:41:12,930 --> 01:41:14,917
because it's two things now, okay?

2201
01:41:14,917 --> 01:41:15,750
- Okay.

2202
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:17,970
- So now that portion
remained part of the city,

2203
01:41:17,970 --> 01:41:20,197
and now a recommendation
will be brought forth

2204
01:41:20,197 --> 01:41:23,550
for the city commission for
the construction of that.

2205
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:25,260
missing portion on Mill Slough,

2206
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:27,960
and then the construction
on Randolph Avenue.

2207
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:31,740
- And I'd like to ask one
other favor, if I could,

2208
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:33,441
anytime we have to vacate,

2209
01:41:33,441 --> 01:41:35,784
or give a right of way,

2210
01:41:35,784 --> 01:41:40,784
just an area, or some people,

2211
01:41:42,624 --> 01:41:47,373
to add all the preparations.

2212
01:41:49,792 --> 01:41:51,880
At least behind it, like the sidewalk,

2213
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:56,220
heads to stoplights, stop sign, sidewalk,

2214
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:59,075
can we take all that into consideration?

2215
01:41:59,075 --> 01:41:59,908
- We do.

2216
01:41:59,908 --> 01:42:02,610
And typically, for vacations like that,

2217
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:05,573
if there are utilities within it,

2218
01:42:05,573 --> 01:42:06,930
you know, if it's mast arms,

2219
01:42:06,930 --> 01:42:09,810
all that's typically in
the right of way anyway.

2220
01:42:09,810 --> 01:42:11,460
So, when you have a vacation,

2221
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:14,040
we're coming before you for a vacation,

2222
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:18,450
it typically does not
include traffic signals,

2223
01:42:18,450 --> 01:42:21,453
you know, those types of
things for a vacation.

2224
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:25,947
And it could be a portion
of the right of way

2225
01:42:25,947 --> 01:42:27,505
and what have you.

2226
01:42:27,505 --> 01:42:29,010
Typically, if it's the
traffic signal and all that,

2227
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:32,670
it needs to stay to be
maintained by the city.

2228
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,476
- You usually, you go
through the right of way,

2229
01:42:34,476 --> 01:42:35,790
and then if there's anything else,

2230
01:42:35,790 --> 01:42:38,853
that comes up later, usually.

2231
01:42:40,110 --> 01:42:44,407
We don't mix it in with
the agenda that we have.

2232
01:42:44,407 --> 01:42:46,200
- We don't, but then
it's up to the discretion

2233
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:50,160
of the Planning Advisory
Board to make conditions,

2234
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:54,159
or you can modify as you so choose to.

2235
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:55,863
- Okay, gotcha.

2236
01:42:58,830 --> 01:43:00,663
- One thing, maybe one way to just,

2237
01:43:03,253 --> 01:43:04,271
what I see,

2238
01:43:04,271 --> 01:43:05,104
what I hear you saying, Bob,

2239
01:43:05,104 --> 01:43:07,743
is that like you wanted
to kind of tell the city

2240
01:43:07,743 --> 01:43:08,576
that if,

2241
01:43:08,576 --> 01:43:10,890
after we make the recommendation
to the city commission,

2242
01:43:10,890 --> 01:43:12,990
if it is determined that
that's sort of too hard,

2243
01:43:12,990 --> 01:43:14,640
or too expensive, or impossible,

2244
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:17,490
that you're telling the city that we'd be,

2245
01:43:17,490 --> 01:43:19,800
that, you know, you're inviting
them to kind of come back

2246
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:22,448
to us with another motion
to do another vacation.

2247
01:43:22,448 --> 01:43:24,277
Is that what you're thinking, or?

2248
01:43:26,504 --> 01:43:27,337
- It doesn't matter.

2249
01:43:27,337 --> 01:43:28,170
- It doesn't matter.

2250
01:43:28,170 --> 01:43:29,580
- You're here to look
at what's on the paper,

2251
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:32,310
make a decision whether
they're right or wrong,

2252
01:43:32,310 --> 01:43:35,130
and if they're wrong, they'll
go back and correct it.

2253
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:36,736
If we're right,

2254
01:43:36,736 --> 01:43:39,090
then it'll go on to the commissioners,

2255
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:40,840
and the commissioners will pass it.

2256
01:43:41,724 --> 01:43:42,557
- But I guess it is,

2257
01:43:42,557 --> 01:43:44,610
it is fully within our
duties to make amendments

2258
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:46,680
to the things coming before the board.

2259
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:49,920
That's part of our job.

2260
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,170
If we think that those amendments are,

2261
01:43:52,170 --> 01:43:53,450
I'm sorry?

2262
01:43:53,450 --> 01:43:55,560
- Say that again.

2263
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:58,290
- So, my understanding
is this board, right,

2264
01:43:58,290 --> 01:44:00,060
we are set up by the city charter,

2265
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:02,430
we have a responsibility
not only to adopt,

2266
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:04,137
but to consider amendments
to the comprehensive plan,

2267
01:44:04,137 --> 01:44:06,687
and to consider actions that
come before this committee,

2268
01:44:06,687 --> 01:44:08,130
and to judge them whether or not

2269
01:44:08,130 --> 01:44:10,140
they're keeping with
the comprehensive plan.

2270
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:13,110
Since this board is governed
by Robert's rules of order,

2271
01:44:13,110 --> 01:44:14,730
Robert's rules of order allows

2272
01:44:14,730 --> 01:44:17,910
for not only the adoption
and rejection of motions,

2273
01:44:17,910 --> 01:44:19,770
but also the amendments of motions,

2274
01:44:19,770 --> 01:44:22,740
and so it's fully within
our power, as a board,

2275
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:24,990
to make amendments or suggestions

2276
01:44:24,990 --> 01:44:27,153
to the agenda items that come before us.

2277
01:44:31,116 --> 01:44:34,033
And I think that's uncontroversial.

2278
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:39,266
- All right. If there's
no more discussion.

2279
01:44:39,266 --> 01:44:40,099
- No discussion.

2280
01:44:40,099 --> 01:44:41,890
- Okay. Do I have a motion to adjourn?

2281
01:44:42,866 --> 01:44:43,830
- Motion to adjourn.

2282
01:44:43,830 --> 01:44:45,240
- All right. Seconded.

2283
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:46,073
(person speaking faintly)

2284
01:44:46,073 --> 01:44:47,093
Adjourned. Thank you.
