1
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:20,270
- We're good to go.

2
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,082
Okay, we're good.

3
00:00:33,082 --> 00:00:34,665
- We're good, okay.

4
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:37,200
Calling the meeting to order at 6:02.

5
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,770
We'll ask everyone to stand for a moment

6
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,023
of silence and pledge allegiance.

7
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,140
I pledge allegiance to the flag

8
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,785
of the United States of
America and to the republic

9
00:00:57,785 --> 00:01:01,958
for which it stands, one
nation under God indivisible,

10
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,190
with liberty and justice for all.

11
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,430
Thank you.

12
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,030
I'm gonna ask everybody
to silence your devices

13
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,493
in the audience and on
the board here, please.

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,070
And also if anybody has
any conflicts of interest

15
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,260
with the agenda item we have tonight

16
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,670
or has had ex parte communication
or done your own research

17
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,273
or anything, please let that
be known, or site visits.

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,251
Nothing under, okay, minutes
approval of February 7th,

19
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:34,160
I just have a question, I
just wanna make sure that,

20
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:40,500
I saw where something happened before

21
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,840
where someone abstained and
that wasn't caught in here.

22
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,630
I wanna make sure there
were no abstentions

23
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,000
that were not caught in the minutes.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,438
No, okay, I was saying
here, I was gonna say.

25
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:53,592
- That's not how we do it.

26
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:57,010
- Okay, all right, motion
to approve the minutes?

27
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,290
- I'll make the motion to approve.

28
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,745
- Alex, motion to approve, second,

29
00:02:01,745 --> 00:02:03,240
any discussion changes, all in favor?

30
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,160
Robert I saw as the second.

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,591
All in favor, please say aye, aye.

32
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:10,380
Opposed, please say no, hearing
none, minutes are approved.

33
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,567
Old business, nothing there,
five, new business, 5A.

34
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,400
- Good evening, this is a
right of way vacation to vacate

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,593
a right of way that's located
on a portion of this property.

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,520
It's about 0.269, and it's a
portion of the larger parcel.

37
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:35,460
This right of way dedication

38
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,817
or what have you was actually
established in agreement

39
00:02:38,817 --> 00:02:41,820
with the city of Kissimmee back in 1972.

40
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,830
At that time, I guess there was a plan

41
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,243
to have a roadway from Vine
Street to cut across down.

42
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,940
There we go, there's some
kind of north south road

43
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,360
at some point in time to cut
across Vine to head south

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,700
into the property to the south.

45
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,227
And eventually, what you don't
see offline is Oak Street,

46
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,190
see it as well, heading east to west,

47
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,410
but I don't think that portion

48
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:13,260
of Oak Street was actually
in existence at that time.

49
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,470
Nonetheless, the current property owner is

50
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,180
in development review now
to redevelop this property

51
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,820
for a hardware store
that's currently in review.

52
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,851
The standard process in
any type of vacation,

53
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:29,297
whether it be a roadway
vacation or an easement

54
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:32,083
to see if Kissimmee has
to send out the request

55
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:36,540
to all the utility providers
and we get those responses.

56
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,420
Those responses were
included in the packet.

57
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,780
We have a couple of folks, as
indicated in the staff report

58
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,730
that they had no objections
to vacating this,

59
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,790
I think it's 47 foot wide
existing right of way agreement,

60
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,290
but they did want to have
and dedicate an easement

61
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,730
in the place where as this
develops, there are utilities,

62
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,870
drainage, or what have you,

63
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,967
so that is the one condition of approval

64
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:07,770
that can be done either via a final plot

65
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,690
or those easement agreements.

66
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,080
Dedications can be done
by another instrument.

67
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,823
So at this point in time,
staff did not receive

68
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,820
any objections to any utility providers,

69
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,070
nor do we have any objections
from any city department

70
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,940
or with our Toho Water or
Kissimmee Utility Authority.

71
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,150
So staff is recommending
approval subject to the condition

72
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,030
of any utility easements or stuff be done

73
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,761
to go to final plat or
through another instrument.

74
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:39,177
- Board members, any
questions for the city?

75
00:04:39,177 --> 00:04:41,099
- Yeah.
- Alex, go ahead.

76
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:44,430
- So yeah, I guess in the packet it noted

77
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,430
that the property below
doesn't seem to be maintaining

78
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,973
the right of way, is that accurate,

79
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:55,993
or do you know, was that
even given or was it?

80
00:04:56,946 --> 00:04:59,360
- We're not clear whether
or not, so that property

81
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,250
to the south right now is
actually under development.

82
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,498
- Yeah.

83
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:05,010
- It's been under development
for quite some time

84
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,620
for a multi-family apartment.

85
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,990
I think it was public works
engineering that made mention

86
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,570
about, I think it was a drainage easement

87
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,695
and not so much a roadway dedication.

88
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:17,162
- Okay.
- For that,

89
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:20,441
so it wasn't any use for a roadway,

90
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:24,360
but there was a question
about drainage easement.

91
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,517
- So I guess like you
said, Oak Street is there,

92
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:28,620
and in terms of the auto network,

93
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,250
it seems like the area is well
served, but once, you know,

94
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,260
right of ways they're given
up, they're hard to get back.

95
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,920
Would there, do you know if
there'd be any interest either

96
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,660
on the city side or whether
the developer would be

97
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,704
interested in maintaining, you
know, not the full 47 feet,

98
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:46,618
but maybe like a pedestrian
path or something?

99
00:05:46,618 --> 00:05:47,451
Because I think this,

100
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:48,776
in keeping with the comprehensive plan,

101
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:53,348
it would be nice to improve
pedestrian, you know,

102
00:05:53,348 --> 00:05:56,237
a dedicated walkway, especially
for multifamily homes

103
00:05:56,237 --> 00:06:00,737
behind it or something, you
know, that might only be 10 feet

104
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:03,434
or you know, some small portion

105
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:04,932
of the existing right of way.

106
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:08,053
Do you know if that's a
possibility of something the city

107
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:10,209
or the developer might be interested in?

108
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:13,232
- So in review for this application,

109
00:06:13,232 --> 00:06:17,277
there wasn't a department that
indicated the need to have

110
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:20,209
or to retain any of this portion

111
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:23,370
as is part of the right of way.

112
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,800
And there wasn't any
indication during the review

113
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,800
to have any plans to dedicate
any new easement for that.

114
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,936
Now, the redevelopment of the site,

115
00:06:35,936 --> 00:06:37,643
you can see the remnant here.

116
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:41,450
So I believe based on, and
you can can speak to this,

117
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,913
but the existing access
is going to remain,

118
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:49,290
the building is going to
be pushed towards the front

119
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,690
because this is in our
form based code area,

120
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,260
and the circulation, if you
will, both the vehicular

121
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,080
and with the pedestrian
is going to be similar

122
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,980
to what you have here, you
can go in on the one way area

123
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,203
and you come back out, so that's a-

124
00:07:04,203 --> 00:07:06,720
- Yeah, I guess, I
mean, Vine Street's kind

125
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,300
of horrendous to either bike or walk on,

126
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,297
and this area of the city in particular,

127
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,192
not particularly well
served pedestrian wise.

128
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:18,428
So it seems like it would
be an opportunity to try

129
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:21,990
to improve pedestrian
connectivity, you know,

130
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,570
and there's already the
existing right of way.

131
00:07:26,723 --> 00:07:29,940
Yeah, is that, again,
this gets to the point

132
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,417
where I'm not sure this is
in the purview of this body

133
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:37,089
or not to suggest or to amend, you know,

134
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,540
to add additional condition
or anything like that.

135
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,540
Is that within the purview
of this body or not?

136
00:07:46,288 --> 00:07:48,797
- It is, but the thing
is I'm not sure whether

137
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:52,590
or not to the south there,
to me it may appear,

138
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,524
it looks like it might be a canal.

139
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:57,790
I'm not quite sure what that
is to the immediate south

140
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:02,040
where it says 12-10 and 12-14.

141
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,650
I don't know whether or not
there's some kind of drainage

142
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,160
or what's within that area,
so that's why I'm, you know,

143
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,520
you can include the condition,
but not knowing for sure

144
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,190
that it can be something
that could be explored.

145
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,570
But I'm not 100% sure whether
or not A, if that's drainage,

146
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,290
or those plans there, there's like a wall

147
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,582
or some type of buffer.

148
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:26,310
- Yeah.

149
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,950
- Because it's residential
against the commercial

150
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:33,405
that there might be a wall, a
fence or a wall requirement.

151
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:36,480
- Yeah, I imagine that's the current plan.

152
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,490
I mean, in the plans that were
submitted in this proposal,

153
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,590
it looks like the plan
was to put a fence up

154
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,420
all around the property line anyway.

155
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,090
But I also feel like that
doesn't do a good job

156
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,967
to serve pedestrian
connectivity, and that's part

157
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:49,417
of why this corridor isn't
well served currently.

158
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,093
So again, yeah, I'm not sure what to-

159
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:57,433
- To your point, because
it's redevelopment

160
00:08:58,794 --> 00:08:59,627
for form-based code,

161
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:03,039
part of the proposed
development will require

162
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,570
a direct pedestrian, I believe

163
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,360
it's on the sidewalk
connection from inside

164
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,540
of the property to the
existing sidewalk along Vine.

165
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,423
- Okay.

166
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:16,140
- Because of the existing drainage,

167
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,690
and you can see the size
of that right of way

168
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,910
from where the property
line is to the edge

169
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,500
of that travel lane,

170
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,080
there's a huge amount
of swales and drainage.

171
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,200
We typically do require that
the sidewalk be widened,

172
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,413
but because of the drainage
issues on the frontage of this,

173
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,193
they're not gonna be able
to widen that sidewalk.

174
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,200
Our long range planning team
has been working with FDOT,

175
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,420
and I believe it passed maybe a year ago

176
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,280
with the Vine Street CRA,

177
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,920
there was a master landscaping plan.

178
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,850
We went through this exercise
of having improvements

179
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,940
along the Vine Street corridor
that includes landscaping.

180
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,510
But part of that exercise
also included constraints,

181
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,490
where we wouldn't even be able
to put in the adequate amount

182
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,482
of landscaping to further
buffer pedestrians

183
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:07,230
with that traveling,

184
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,870
because that's the intent
of providing landscaping

185
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,200
or have what we call a
furnishing zone, introduce

186
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,637
more green space between
the property and all that.

187
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:17,557
- I guess, yeah, I understand

188
00:10:17,557 --> 00:10:20,370
that's the long-term plan for Vine Street.

189
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,110
Vine Street's also a state road,

190
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,270
so a lot of this is outside
of the city's hands.

191
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,650
So then I guess it feels like
as far as the city's concerned

192
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,840
as far as this comprehensive
plan is concerned,

193
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,010
it does feel like, again, I
guess it feels like instead

194
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,510
of giving up the entire right of way,

195
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,280
I could understand giving
up the right of way

196
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,950
or the plans to build a road
at this location in the future.

197
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,220
But I feel like it would
be in the city's interest

198
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,880
and would help to comprehensive
plan to retain some right

199
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,030
or easement for a pedestrian
path in the future.

200
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,060
Just it feels like otherwise once lost,

201
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,570
then the existing connectivity issues

202
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,343
in this corridor would be cemented,

203
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,070
and that feels like, you know,

204
00:11:06,544 --> 00:11:08,820
I don't know, it feels
like retaining five feet

205
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,250
or something to allow
for a potential path,

206
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,950
allowing all those residential
units better connectivity

207
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,570
instead of having to walk, you know,

208
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,520
a half mile around the Oak Street

209
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,267
and back to the front feels
like something worth exploring,

210
00:11:23,547 --> 00:11:26,310
and it feels like this is the
last opportunity for that,

211
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,980
because once the right of way is given up,

212
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,163
then it feels like there would be no,

213
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,090
there'd be no opportunity in the future.

214
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,885
- So when you say it's
five feet, are you talking

215
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:43,885
about retaining, it's
47 feet wide right now,

216
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,150
so you're talking about
retaining five feet of that?

217
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,010
- Yeah.
- North-south?

218
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,090
- Yeah, well a strip, you know,
instead of the 47 feet wide,

219
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,508
or I don't know what the requirements are

220
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:57,270
for the city for pedestrian paths.

221
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,727
I should have looked that up,

222
00:11:58,727 --> 00:12:01,833
but certainly don't need 47 feet, right?

223
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,917
And that feels like still the
developer would get access to,

224
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:13,020
you know, 42 feet for their parking lot,

225
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,040
which seems like it's the plan,

226
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,270
but the city would also
have the opportunity to try

227
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,847
to improve some of the
connectivity for bikes

228
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:22,710
and pedestrians in this area,

229
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,170
which is poorly absorbed currently.

230
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,640
And I'm not sure what the
long-term plan there is,

231
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,890
especially given that
Vine Street's a state road

232
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,893
and we don't have control.

233
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:35,226
- But at this time, is the applicant here?

234
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:37,939
Sir, would you like to say any words?

235
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:39,581
You don't have to, but
you have the opportunity

236
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:40,795
to speak if you like.

237
00:12:40,795 --> 00:12:43,761
Please step to the microphone,
state your address,

238
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:46,211
your name and your address
for the record please.

239
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,250
- Good evening, the Michael Hadad.

240
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:55,250
I am representing Kelly Horn
today who's representing

241
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,340
then the applicant address
is 200 South Orange Avenue,

242
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,453
Orlando, Florida.

243
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,643
So well, I'm here
representing the applicant.

244
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,090
I cannot speak in regard to the easement.

245
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,544
I know they needed it
for planning of the site

246
00:13:11,544 --> 00:13:13,920
and shifting the building

247
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,920
and accommodating parking and
all, but and I can't speak

248
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,300
for the five foot easement
north-south connection.

249
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,280
I know the development to the south,

250
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,147
I don't know if there's direct connection

251
00:13:25,147 --> 00:13:29,480
that can even accommodate
that five feet north-south

252
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,170
if it's trying to be accomplished.

253
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,260
- Yeah, I'm not sure either,
but I guess, you know,

254
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,429
if the easement is given up
then there'd be no opportunity

255
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:40,003
to connect any of the
adjacent properties, right?

256
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:43,140
Whereas if it was retained
or that could be a reason

257
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,590
to add a door or a gate through
the wall if there is one.

258
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,910
You know, again, I don't know the status

259
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,230
for the south (indistinct) property,

260
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,720
but yeah, go ahead.

261
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,760
- Yeah, understood.

262
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,850
It'd be worth looking at the site plan

263
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,230
for the development to the south,

264
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,160
but I mean, there could be a wall

265
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,663
that prevents that entirely.

266
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,087
So I mean, I can take this
question back to the applicant

267
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:03,510
and look at that further,

268
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,150
but I mean, we're still
planning to move forward

269
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,886
with approval and agree with
staff's request to do so.

270
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:10,770
- Do we have any other board members

271
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,523
with questions or comments?

272
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:18,793
If not, we'll ask any motions
regarding this agenda item.

273
00:14:20,716 --> 00:14:21,715
(indistinct)

274
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:24,723
Asking for any motions
regarding this agenda item.

275
00:14:26,204 --> 00:14:27,940
- I'll make a motion to approve.

276
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,796
- With the easement condition?

277
00:14:29,796 --> 00:14:30,689
- Yes.
- Okay.

278
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:31,571
We have a motion to approve

279
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,890
with the easement condition
already regarding utilities.

280
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:39,890
- Can I clarify like just
how general of the condition

281
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,313
so I can capture that the
additional added condition?

282
00:14:45,528 --> 00:14:46,411
- Sorry.

283
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:49,542
(overlapping speech)

284
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:51,750
- Hold on, hold on, we
have motion on the floor.

285
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,583
- Yeah.

286
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,293
- Specifically state it again.

287
00:14:56,864 --> 00:15:01,447
- Make motion to approve (indistinct).

288
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,430
- As proposed by the city or?

289
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,756
- Is that with the drainage easement?

290
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:11,009
- Okay, so easements for
utilities were already

291
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:14,085
in place, yes, agreed upon?

292
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:16,890
- That was the condition
recommendation for the utility.

293
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,330
- Okay, is your motion inclusive of that?

294
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,824
- Yes.
- Okay,

295
00:15:21,824 --> 00:15:24,241
do we have a second for that?

296
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:27,578
- Do we need to-

297
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:29,040
- We can have discussion,
we'll have opportunity

298
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,340
for discussion, but if we
don't have a second, it dies.

299
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,893
So do have a second of the motion?

300
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,013
- I think I'd like to discuss more,

301
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:41,985
at least get Alex's concerns tabled.

302
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:46,847
I mean, I think Brenda, were
you talking about adding his?

303
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:47,680
- Okay, I'm sorry, Melissa,

304
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,483
I'm just asking strictly for
a second, do we have a second?

305
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,770
- I think he's concerned procedurally

306
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,320
in order to proceed and even
have a discussion on the item.

307
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,330
- Yes, we will have the discussion,

308
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,410
absolutely welcome to that,

309
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,860
but I need to know if we have a second.

310
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:08,220
We have a second for
Melissa, okay, discussion.

311
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,200
- Okay, yeah, so regarding discussion,

312
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,230
I understand the city came
to us and they didn't really,

313
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,190
they didn't have a problem

314
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,860
with giving up the entire
right of way, I guess.

315
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,050
Yeah, looking at it, looking
at this area of the city,

316
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,650
it does seem like this is a
particularly poor served area

317
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,450
for pedestrian and bike traffic, right?

318
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,331
This is Vine Street and
Oak Street right there.

319
00:16:27,331 --> 00:16:29,490
And so I just know that, you know,

320
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,658
once the right of way is given
up by the city, these things,

321
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,630
you know, they never get 'em back right?

322
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,040
'cause the developments
are on 'em and stuff,

323
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,750
and so it seems like that would preclude

324
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,870
any future opportunity to
try to build things out.

325
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,290
And so yeah, it just, I guess it just,

326
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,320
it feels like something
that we should weigh.

327
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,840
And I guess I wonder whether, you know,

328
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,193
looking at the site plan, if
the city retained, you know,

329
00:16:52,193 --> 00:16:55,020
a few feet, then it seems
like it would still provide

330
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,570
an opportunity and wouldn't
really impact, you know,

331
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,010
there'd be a few feet of extra
concrete for the parking lot.

332
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,547
Felt like something worth
considering and suggesting, so.

333
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:07,449
- Can I just clarify for a second?

334
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:11,196
Just because this right
of way is being vacated,

335
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:16,196
it doesn't mean that the city,
if this is gonna be platted,

336
00:17:16,922 --> 00:17:20,839
so the reason to request for the vacation

337
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,839
of all of it is that it would
change your boundary lines

338
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:30,093
for purposes of setbacks
and stuff like that,

339
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:35,657
and other buffering requirements,
so that would be why,

340
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,983
part of why the request is being made.

341
00:17:41,983 --> 00:17:46,110
If it's granted and the applicant
goes to develop the site,

342
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,102
that doesn't necessarily
mean that some of the things

343
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:54,102
that you wanna see on the site
won't actually come later on.

344
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,345
So if you platted it, that
doesn't mean that you,

345
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,728
I'm not saying that the applicant
is planning on doing this.

346
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:05,109
It's not necessarily a lost
opportunity for this city,

347
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:08,789
'cause you don't know if some, you know,

348
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,863
right away would be dedicated to the city

349
00:18:10,863 --> 00:18:13,323
when that property is being improved.

350
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,133
So I see what you're saying.

351
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:22,133
It just kind of makes it clear
to develop the whole site

352
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:27,104
if that unused right of way
is vacated in its entirety.

353
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:30,720
- I understand.
- I'm sorry,

354
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,800
Robert's rules of order.

355
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,150
I wanna give Melissa a chance to speak

356
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,410
'cause she hasn't spoken on it yet,

357
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,648
and I know you had some
comments, go ahead.

358
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:37,615
- I was just trying to make sure

359
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:42,235
that we had gotten Alex's
concerns brought up.

360
00:18:42,235 --> 00:18:46,801
(indistinct) items, and
then also to mention

361
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:50,062
the applicant's comment
that it doesn't appear

362
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:53,480
this plot is (indistinct) also,

363
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,739
so there's not another easement
adjacent to the sidewalk

364
00:18:56,739 --> 00:19:01,739
(indistinct) if that works
being on the frontage.

365
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:07,831
I mean, if it was all
developed (indistinct),

366
00:19:08,237 --> 00:19:11,597
essentially, a five foot gap
that may never be developed,

367
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:16,193
and just becomes (indistinct)
water (indistinct).

368
00:19:16,193 --> 00:19:17,670
- Other board members,
comments or questions?

369
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,260
Alex, if you have something
else we'll come back to you,

370
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,759
but I wanna make sure we get
everybody else's before you.

371
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:23,939
Anybody, Alex did you have more?

372
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:26,487
- No, I mean I think I voiced my-

373
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:30,210
- Okay, my thoughts about
this are a couple things.

374
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,920
If we're talking about a walkway,

375
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,540
we're talking about the
city developing that

376
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,530
and paying for that, are we
talking about leaving that

377
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,007
for the city to do in the future?

378
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,327
And the other thing is
we don't know the intent

379
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:47,940
of the developer to the
south if they would even want

380
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,530
such a thing to access their
property, I don't know.

381
00:19:53,395 --> 00:19:55,790
- The development to the
south is quite a large.

382
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,008
(indistinct)

383
00:19:59,008 --> 00:19:59,841
- Yeah.

384
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:03,963
- It's a quite (indistinct)
type plot of ground

385
00:20:03,963 --> 00:20:05,548
that they're developing a portion.

386
00:20:05,548 --> 00:20:07,965
(indistinct)

387
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:11,327
- Okay.

388
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:13,807
- It's a huge complex
that they're putting in,

389
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:16,387
so he's actually locked in.

390
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:18,599
(indistinct)

391
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:20,238
And the parcel we're talking about,

392
00:20:20,238 --> 00:20:21,722
they're gonna have a right of way anyway.

393
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:24,718
If the city needs to get in,
they're gonna get in there.

394
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:27,811
So for us to let him have
it, that's no problem,

395
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:31,011
because we have access to it anyway.

396
00:20:31,011 --> 00:20:32,222
- For utility purposes?

397
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:33,098
- For utility purposes.

398
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,366
- Yeah, I guess my
concern is just, I mean,

399
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:40,140
do we know, I dunno the
details of the development

400
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,790
to the south, but looking at it, it looked

401
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,340
like it was a multi-family
type development.

402
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,010
So it's gonna be a lot of
people, and if we don't want

403
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,780
all those people to always
have to get in their car

404
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,168
in order to drive everywhere,
there are businesses

405
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,830
on Vine Street within a block of there,

406
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,170
there's, you know, a deli that
I like that's really good.

407
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,290
There's things like that, and you know,

408
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,280
if this is all closed off,
then that means having to walk

409
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,900
out to Oak Street, up Oak Street,

410
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,684
and along Vine Street,
and nobody enjoys that.

411
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:09,521
And it just feels like
this is the kind of thing

412
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:11,727
that we're put here to try to think about

413
00:21:11,727 --> 00:21:13,290
and consider these alternatives,

414
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,760
and so I wanted to put it out there.

415
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,200
I understand it would
be slightly inconvenient

416
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,917
for the applicant and for
the city to reconsider this

417
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:26,406
and do all that planning, but I would feel

418
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:29,055
amiss not to have brought up the issue.

419
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:33,333
- Just to clarify further,
there could be opportunities

420
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,500
for, you know, traversing the property

421
00:21:38,535 --> 00:21:41,681
and connectivity up to Vine Street

422
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:44,173
without it being city right of way.

423
00:21:44,173 --> 00:21:45,932
- But if I understand,

424
00:21:45,932 --> 00:21:49,020
I can understand that that
would totally be a possibility.

425
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,110
But if I understand correctly,
it would also totally be

426
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,540
up to the applicant at that point, right?

427
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,540
- To a certain extent, but the
applicant would not be able

428
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,340
to develop the property

429
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,490
all the way over to the property line.

430
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,323
- No.

431
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,838
- So they're gonna have,

432
00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:07,710
I don't know what their site
plan is, but I'm assuming

433
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,090
because it's a place of business,

434
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,860
they're gonna have drive aisles.

435
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,200
- Yeah, at least looking at
the site plan that we got

436
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,220
in our materials, it looked
like that plan was to build

437
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,550
a fence around the entire
property, close everything off,

438
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,290
and yes, have access from Vine Street,

439
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,973
primarily for automobiles, but.

440
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,200
- Brenda, just outta curiosity,

441
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,950
how long has that land been vacant?

442
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:35,266
- I found that there
was a demolition permit

443
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:36,865
that was pulled in 2011.

444
00:22:36,865 --> 00:22:38,650
So there was a building that was there.

445
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,226
I couldn't find the exact building permit

446
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:45,504
when that building was
established, but it was demolished.

447
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,580
A commercial building
was demolished in 2011.

448
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,553
- Okay, so about 14, 15 years, okay.

449
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:54,613
- Do we have another
picture of the wider area?

450
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:01,988
(indistinct)

451
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,099
- It's pretty white out.

452
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,250
- It's white rabbit in a snow storm.

453
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,667
(indistinct)

454
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:42,684
- Correct me if I'm wrong.

455
00:23:42,684 --> 00:23:46,710
A development that's this
small would not require

456
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:51,603
to put in any kind of
street, so that's where,

457
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,283
and I don't think that, you
know, the city wouldn't,

458
00:23:57,105 --> 00:23:59,605
at this point in time, put in.

459
00:24:00,553 --> 00:24:01,530
I see what you're saying,

460
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:05,243
to preserve it for future
development, right?

461
00:24:06,415 --> 00:24:09,820
- Yeah, I guess, sorry, I don't know,

462
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,100
can I make another comment?

463
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,196
Are we still in the
comment period or whatever?

464
00:24:12,196 --> 00:24:13,708
I just wanted to make sure

465
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:16,227
I'm not violating the
Roberts rules, we're good?

466
00:24:16,227 --> 00:24:20,248
Yeah, oh, so anyway, looking
at the comprehensive plan,

467
00:24:20,248 --> 00:24:22,160
one of the things the city plan, you know,

468
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,168
promises to do was to
increase the level of service

469
00:24:24,168 --> 00:24:25,986
for pedestrians and bikes.

470
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:29,188
It's not clear to me where
we are on that thing,

471
00:24:29,188 --> 00:24:30,919
on the way to doing that,

472
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:33,920
or what the sort of detailed
plans are for building this.

473
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,918
Looking at this site, knowing
now that the city has a right

474
00:24:38,918 --> 00:24:41,146
of way on this property and
this property is heading

475
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,742
directly towards a multifamily unit,

476
00:24:43,742 --> 00:24:47,101
and in an area that does have multi use,

477
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:51,455
it feels like one of the
places the city should consider

478
00:24:51,455 --> 00:24:54,665
or should have considered
for potentially improving

479
00:24:54,665 --> 00:24:59,098
pedestrian and bike level
service, and I understand

480
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:00,750
that there would still be opportunities

481
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,826
if the developer was willing
to do things in the future,

482
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:07,524
but my understanding is
also that once this right

483
00:25:07,524 --> 00:25:10,679
of way is given up, that it is like,

484
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,669
then it's at the goodwill of the developer

485
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:15,244
and no longer in the city
kind of loses a degree

486
00:25:15,244 --> 00:25:17,631
of control as to whether
or not they can execute

487
00:25:17,631 --> 00:25:21,544
on the plan, if I'm
correct on that, right?

488
00:25:21,544 --> 00:25:22,906
Yes.
- I'm trying to see,

489
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:25,873
what is the width of this easement?

490
00:25:25,873 --> 00:25:27,425
- 47 foot wide.

491
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,027
- 47 foot wide, okay.

492
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,360
- 250 feet long.

493
00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:32,440
- Okay.

494
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,478
- I think the city's priority,
because we have to set

495
00:25:36,478 --> 00:25:38,920
priorities, is the Vine Street corridor

496
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,546
for pedestrian
connectivity, so this is why

497
00:25:41,546 --> 00:25:45,594
for redevelopment along
Vine Street, we're requiring

498
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:50,594
that the sidewalk be widened
to 12 foot wide where possible,

499
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,278
because we understand
that there are utilities,

500
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:55,272
there are drainage issues, what have you,

501
00:25:55,272 --> 00:26:00,272
and all of that now is the
requirement for by the developer,

502
00:26:00,586 --> 00:26:04,020
but it's where it is feasible to do,

503
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,912
'cause we understand again,

504
00:26:04,912 --> 00:26:08,694
like for this particular
property there's a huge swale,

505
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:12,150
there's utilities that
makes it impossible,

506
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,184
so the priority is

507
00:26:13,184 --> 00:26:15,780
along the Vine Street corridor east-west.

508
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,248
- Yeah, and I guess, I
mean, maybe to clarify

509
00:26:18,248 --> 00:26:21,214
what I'm thinking, given what you said,

510
00:26:21,214 --> 00:26:23,656
level of service for pedestrian and bike

511
00:26:23,656 --> 00:26:26,672
along Vine Street is already poor.

512
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:28,670
It sounds like with
this site in particular,

513
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,892
there's already issues with
trying to extend the sidewalk

514
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:35,127
facing Vine Street east-west.

515
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,460
But another part of the
story of connectivity

516
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,252
to Vine Street for
pedestrian and bike is giving

517
00:26:40,252 --> 00:26:43,975
other alternatives for
pedestrians and bikes to get to,

518
00:26:43,975 --> 00:26:46,046
you know, on and off Vine Street,

519
00:26:46,046 --> 00:26:48,748
and so what I was imagining
was instead of giving up

520
00:26:48,748 --> 00:26:53,422
the full 47 foot easement,
if the city retained,

521
00:26:53,422 --> 00:26:55,384
it sounds like if the
plan was to try to go

522
00:26:55,384 --> 00:26:57,147
to 12 foot sidewalks,
then it would make sense

523
00:26:57,147 --> 00:27:01,931
to try to maintain as
much as 12 feet of the 47,

524
00:27:01,931 --> 00:27:05,289
and still provide an
developer with the space

525
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:08,514
that I imagine they would
need to try to build

526
00:27:08,514 --> 00:27:11,226
a nice property that would
give the city an opportunity

527
00:27:11,226 --> 00:27:14,814
to try to improve what
is otherwise a difficult

528
00:27:14,814 --> 00:27:17,728
to improve pedestrian and bike story

529
00:27:17,728 --> 00:27:21,118
for this segment of Vine Street east-west.

530
00:27:21,118 --> 00:27:22,196
- But keep in mind I think part

531
00:27:22,196 --> 00:27:26,779
of what you are also requesting
hinges upon cooperation

532
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,564
from that development to the south

533
00:27:31,564 --> 00:27:33,978
as far as even accessing the property.

534
00:27:33,978 --> 00:27:36,054
So if we move forward with the retaining

535
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:39,997
of the five feet, again, if
there's not that coordination

536
00:27:39,997 --> 00:27:44,324
or feasibility to provide
continuing connection

537
00:27:44,324 --> 00:27:47,187
to the south, so this is
why we put that if it's,

538
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:48,894
I wanted clarification on that condition

539
00:27:48,894 --> 00:27:53,434
to where if it's feasible to
do, because we have to go back

540
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:56,849
and see whether or not that
connection can continue

541
00:27:56,849 --> 00:28:00,046
to the south or be if that
property owner is interested

542
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:04,410
in continuing that connection
through the property.

543
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,061
- Right, but things like that don't happen

544
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:10,862
without dedication and
wherewithal of the city then

545
00:28:10,862 --> 00:28:12,674
to try to make things like that happen.

546
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:16,194
But I think the alternative
to give up the full right

547
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,413
of way means that it's
much less likely to happen

548
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:22,942
than retaining it, so I again
felt as though it was my duty

549
00:28:22,942 --> 00:28:26,381
to look out for, especially
like the pedestrian

550
00:28:26,381 --> 00:28:29,447
and bike parts of the comprehensive plan,

551
00:28:29,447 --> 00:28:32,864
felt like this was a place to voice that.

552
00:28:34,782 --> 00:28:36,331
- I have a question, is it okay

553
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:38,162
if I look at my phone
to look at Google Maps,

554
00:28:38,162 --> 00:28:40,058
to look at a satellite image of this area?

555
00:28:40,058 --> 00:28:42,469
I just wanna make sure I'm not.

556
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:44,886
(indistinct)

557
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:47,535
I just wanted to see-

558
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:52,535
- I think Brenda can pull it
up on the screen for everybody.

559
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,463
- I just wanna get a wider satellite view.

560
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,107
Yeah, so that's okay.

561
00:29:16,335 --> 00:29:17,717
I guess I speak from a
little bit of experience,

562
00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:20,580
'cause I regularly bike
along Oak Street here,

563
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,063
and go, you know, I
also try to regularly go

564
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:25,890
to a couple of places on Vine Street,

565
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,680
but I'm terrified to go
east-west on Vine Street,

566
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,430
so I instead try to look for
any other opportunity to get on

567
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:35,460
and off Vine Street as
kind of near as possible,

568
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,880
and part of the way I accomplish
that is to go through,

569
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,680
you know, parking lots
and things like that

570
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:45,390
and try to find other ways
to connect, and I mean,

571
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,130
especially if there's
a lot of families there

572
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,097
that want to try to frequent any

573
00:29:49,097 --> 00:29:51,270
of the little restaurants
and stuff along the way

574
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,400
instead of having to
walk all the way around,

575
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,850
which one would have to
do, it's more a chance-

576
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,690
- This is a, the business
again is a hardware store?

577
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,523
- Yes.
- Okay.

578
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:07,323
I'm gonna ask the applicant's
representative a question.

579
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,896
Could you see, well, and maybe
you can't even answer this,

580
00:30:11,896 --> 00:30:16,313
but maybe would it be actually
potentially beneficial

581
00:30:18,696 --> 00:30:23,696
for a business like your
client's to have access

582
00:30:25,136 --> 00:30:27,650
for these are these multi-units,

583
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:32,087
these many multifamily units
to be able to get there,

584
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:35,073
would that be beneficial
for them possibly?

585
00:30:37,812 --> 00:30:38,645
- I actually came up to say

586
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:40,615
I could not answer that question, but-

587
00:30:40,615 --> 00:30:42,930
- I guessed that, but you
know, I thought I'd ask,

588
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,116
because you know, a lot of
times with retail business,

589
00:30:45,116 --> 00:30:50,116
having traffic coming by
in a good way is a plus,

590
00:30:50,554 --> 00:30:55,554
and to Alex's point, I
understand some of the concerns.

591
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:00,267
Does this development to the south,

592
00:31:00,267 --> 00:31:05,267
well, I guess to the south,
would they even want this,

593
00:31:06,087 --> 00:31:07,953
do they have plans of some sort of wall

594
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:10,973
or some sort of, you know,
we don't know any of that,

595
00:31:10,973 --> 00:31:15,242
but I can certainly see
where it could be beneficial

596
00:31:15,242 --> 00:31:16,453
for the people living here,

597
00:31:16,453 --> 00:31:19,025
and potentially beneficial for the client

598
00:31:19,025 --> 00:31:23,628
if they then have potentially
all these customers

599
00:31:23,628 --> 00:31:27,105
that could then just access that.

600
00:31:27,105 --> 00:31:30,360
But it's their property,
do they want that or not?

601
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,243
But I also see that that
would cut off a huge amount

602
00:31:33,243 --> 00:31:38,010
of walking or whatever to
get over to Vine Street

603
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:41,627
and so forth, so I get that,
and possibly alleviate,

604
00:31:41,627 --> 00:31:45,460
you know, the foot traffic
or the car traffic,

605
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:52,116
although is there any other,
what I'm looking at here,

606
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,470
do any of us know if there's
any other pedestrian access

607
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:03,470
to go up to where the Wells
Fargo and the restaurants are?

608
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,880
I don't see it.
- Go up Magnolia.

609
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,010
- Don't see it.
- That's better for me.

610
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:12,240
So I regularly avoid
going along Vine Street

611
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,403
by coming up Magnolia,
'cause that's quiet.

612
00:32:15,805 --> 00:32:19,590
- I go by this area quite a
bit actually, and then there's

613
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,709
the Orlando Health Physician Associates,

614
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:26,564
the preschool there, but
again we don't even know

615
00:32:26,564 --> 00:32:29,580
if something could be physically put there

616
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,420
because of the swale

617
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,480
and because of the drainage and all that,

618
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,750
so it would take a lot more to figure out

619
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,715
if that could be possible.

620
00:32:38,715 --> 00:32:41,846
But I understand what you're saying,

621
00:32:41,846 --> 00:32:46,846
just having it an easement
for a future foot traffic path

622
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:52,527
or sidewalk going from
this area up to there.

623
00:32:52,527 --> 00:32:56,173
A lot of questions, and
if it didn't turn out

624
00:32:56,173 --> 00:32:58,070
where that development
to the south wanted that,

625
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,040
or if they're putting in a wall

626
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,080
or something that wasn't
gonna work for that,

627
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,137
then it would be a moot point anyway,

628
00:33:03,137 --> 00:33:05,817
and it wouldn't cost anyone anything,

629
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,200
and it could be a potential plus.

630
00:33:10,641 --> 00:33:11,515
Potentially, I mean, I could see

631
00:33:11,515 --> 00:33:13,080
some potential downsides too,

632
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,497
but for a retail business, your thoughts?

633
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:19,575
- So just to give a little bit flavor

634
00:33:19,575 --> 00:33:21,120
of your question of whether or
not it would directly impact

635
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,900
or be beneficial to the
applicant, when you think

636
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,400
of a pedestrian generator,
you're thinking of a restaurant

637
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,680
or something similar to that nature.

638
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,555
So as a, you know, for
the applicant itself,

639
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:34,320
you know, for a hardware
store, I wouldn't expect it

640
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,850
to be a high pedestrian generator
as a restaurant would be,

641
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,573
to back up and give some flavor
to your question previously.

642
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:47,700
- Okay, okay, so at this point,

643
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,671
unless we have any other
comments or questions,

644
00:33:50,671 --> 00:33:52,663
we do have a motion on the floor,

645
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,576
we have a second, and
we've had discussion,

646
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:59,067
so I'm gonna ask for a vote for approval.

647
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,040
If it passes, it passes.

648
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,103
If it does not, then another
motion could be made.

649
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,513
Go ahead, Alex.

650
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:09,660
- And I guess just to clarify,

651
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,166
right now we are voting on the, you know,

652
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:16,050
item 5A as presented to us by the city,

653
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,992
which would mean giving
up the full easement

654
00:34:18,992 --> 00:34:22,171
but retaining, or sorry,
giving up the full right of way

655
00:34:22,171 --> 00:34:27,171
but retaining a utility easement
and that is all, correct,

656
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,400
that's what we're voting for?

657
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,400
- Utility would not somehow
include pedestrian walkway,

658
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,560
just strictly for KUA, Toho, whatever.

659
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,680
- And it's not just, it's any,
because also it was Spectrum.

660
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,440
There was a cable, they
have infrastructure,

661
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,230
so that's why we worded the condition

662
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:50,790
to say any new utility easements,
not just the, you know,

663
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,527
electricity, the Spectrum.

664
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:55,407
- Any utilities, okay, but
that would not envelope

665
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:58,683
a pedestrian walkway, that
wouldn't be inclusive of that.

666
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,880
Okay, so we have a motion on
the floor, we have a second.

667
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,440
If we don't have any further discussion,

668
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,003
then I'll put it to a vote.

669
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:09,750
All in favor, please say aye, aye.

670
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,286
Opposed, please say no.

671
00:35:11,286 --> 00:35:12,119
- No.

672
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,100
- Okay, so we had Alex with a no.

673
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,140
Do we have the rest aye?

674
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,520
Four to one, aye,

675
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,843
okay, so the motion carries.

676
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,500
Next, public hearings, nothing there.

677
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,590
Discussion, nothing there.

678
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,560
Here, chairman and board members,

679
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,750
I just wanna point out that
when I actually ended the,

680
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,490
you know, what you were saying, Alex,

681
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:44,732
and what you're saying, Melissa,
you know, it's just trying

682
00:35:44,732 --> 00:35:46,740
to make sure we get through
the procedure and get it done,

683
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,230
because yeah, I've been in meetings

684
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,374
before where it gets bogged down.

685
00:35:51,374 --> 00:35:53,520
Not that those comments shouldn't be said,

686
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,312
they absolutely should
be heard on the record,

687
00:35:55,312 --> 00:35:56,145
but we have to do it in a certain order

688
00:35:56,145 --> 00:35:57,750
so we don't go round and round around,

689
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,783
so please accept that in the
spirit in which it was done.

690
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:05,312
Board members, any other comments?

691
00:36:05,312 --> 00:36:06,333
- We have a motion to adjourn.

692
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:09,927
- We have motion, well, next meeting?

693
00:36:09,927 --> 00:36:13,230
- I believe we are working on another item

694
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,880
for the next April 3rd meeting.

695
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,920
I will keep you posted and updated.

696
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,253
It's still like a project
in progress for people.

697
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:23,461
- So that would be for what date?

698
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:25,034
- April 3rd, I think.

699
00:36:25,034 --> 00:36:27,161
(overlapping speech)

700
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:30,420
Please look out for the
emails, and when you do,

701
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,230
just you could say yes or no
when we get to that point,

702
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,510
but I think I'll know
hopefully the next couple

703
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,820
of days whether or not
we will have an item

704
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,768
for that April 3rd Planning
Advisory Board meeting.

705
00:36:41,768 --> 00:36:43,582
- Okay.
- One item.

706
00:36:43,582 --> 00:36:47,467
- Okay, and Melissa, I heard
you made a motion to adjourn?

707
00:36:47,467 --> 00:36:48,300
- Yes sir.

708
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,221
- Do we have a second?

709
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:50,105
- I second.

710
00:36:50,105 --> 00:36:51,780
- Second, Robert, any discussion?

711
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,190
All in favor, please say aye.

712
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,066
- Aye.

713
00:36:54,066 --> 00:36:56,131
- Well, yeah, I guess.

714
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,997
- Anybody opposed, please say no.

715
00:36:57,997 --> 00:36:59,820
- I'm not opposed to adjourning.

716
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,100
I was hoping to just thank you, everyone,

717
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,050
for tolerating my comments
and discussion, so thank you.

718
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,236
- Absolutely.

719
00:37:07,236 --> 00:37:08,677
- It's not toleration, it's part

720
00:37:08,677 --> 00:37:13,378
of what you're supposed to
do is voice your thoughts.

721
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:15,795
(indistinct)

722
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,309
- I'll check it out.

723
00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:33,103
(indistinct)

724
00:37:33,103 --> 00:37:34,500
- 'Cause we're not far from it at all.

725
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,931
Bowling alley is here, then
you've got your businesses,

726
00:37:36,931 --> 00:37:38,963
and then they can put
a restaurant in there.

727
00:37:38,963 --> 00:37:40,920
It's a real good one.

728
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,123
- I will check that out.

729
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,730
- I've seen that vacant.

730
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,758
I've come by that I don't
know how many times.

731
00:37:47,758 --> 00:37:48,591
(indistinct)

732
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:49,440
They're building a big,

733
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,990
I think it's a medical center in here.

734
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:56,283
They gotta leave this open
and that one for the drainage.

735
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,971
Anyway, have fun, nice seeing you.

736
00:38:01,971 --> 00:38:02,869
- Nice seeing you.

737
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:03,811
I'll see you in a couple weeks.

738
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:07,457
- Possibly, as long as it's
not April 1st. (laughs)

739
00:38:13,442 --> 00:38:15,859
(indistinct)

740
00:38:17,326 --> 00:38:18,245
- Ready to go?

741
00:38:18,245 --> 00:38:20,662
(indistinct)

742
00:38:21,737 --> 00:38:22,876
- See you, Jerry, see you, Robert.

743
00:38:22,876 --> 00:38:25,293
(indistinct)

744
00:38:32,706 --> 00:38:33,614
- Yes.

745
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:36,031
(indistinct)

746
00:38:45,342 --> 00:38:49,175
- Maybe stop by (indistinct).

747
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:11,294
(indistinct)

748
00:41:13,058 --> 00:41:15,279
- Thank you, guys, have a good night.

749
00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:17,696
(indistinct)

750
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:39,343
- You could suggest to them.

751
00:42:39,343 --> 00:42:41,760
