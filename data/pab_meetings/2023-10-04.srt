1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,410
- [Robert] Okay, we're good to go.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,170
Calling the meeting to order six o'clock.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,870
Please everyone silence your devices.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,400
Everyone on the board here too please.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,080
And please stand for a moment of silence

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,133
and the Pledge of Allegiance.

7
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:25,504
- [Everyone] I pledge
allegiance to the flag

8
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:27,643
of the United States of America

9
00:00:27,643 --> 00:00:30,015
and to the Republic for which it stands

10
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:32,623
one nation, under God, indisible,

11
00:00:32,623 --> 00:00:35,373
with liberty and justice for all.

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,700
- [Robert] Thanks everybody.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,240
Welcome, and we are looking at the minutes

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,910
from our September 6th meeting.

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,180
I actually see an error on here,

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,080
if we could change that

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,748
where it says, Chairman Robert Buotier

18
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:53,581
adjourned the meeting.

19
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:54,630
My name is misspelled.

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,030
So we've got one R in there.

21
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,273
Just a little detail.

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,973
Other than that,

23
00:01:01,973 --> 00:01:04,743
does anyone have any motions
regarding these minutes?

24
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:11,850
Okay, actually yeah, I'm sorry

25
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:12,810
I was looking at the wrong thing here.

26
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,360
Yep, motion to approve by Diana.

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,590
Second Robert.

28
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,944
All in favor, please say aye.

29
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:18,777
- [Board] Aye.

30
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:20,160
- [Robert] Opposed, please say no.

31
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,413
Hearing none minutes are approved.

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,580
And we are at, I'm sorry

33
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,170
getting all my papers mixed up here.

34
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,628
Okay old business, nothing new business.

35
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:34,461
5A.

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,260
- [Brenda] Good evening.

37
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,210
This is a conditional use
request for the development

38
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,170
of town homes within our T4R Transex zone.

39
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,660
This property, as it's
noted here on the map

40
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,570
is going to be on the
south side of June Street.

41
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,880
It's also just south of Martin Luther King

42
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,433
about a block east from
John Young Parkway.

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,480
Initially when this application
came in with the applicant,

44
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,860
it was initially as
apartments or a fourplex,

45
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,410
but going through our initial
development review committee

46
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,040
or DRC with all the
different requirements,

47
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,043
it was redesigned to be
three simple town homes

48
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:16,893
just the three units for the town homes.

49
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,950
The new town home layout

50
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,530
you have in your supporting packet.

51
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,940
I wanna also spend some
time here to also take note

52
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,090
of the development that's
happening within this area here.

53
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,230
And I've prepared a map.

54
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,523
Just one second.

55
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,290
I zoomed out a little bit here.

56
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,830
So the A represents the subject
property that we're talking

57
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,063
about tonight.

58
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:48,270
B, I'm not sure some of you recall back

59
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,110
in, I think earlier this year, in July,

60
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,840
this was the approval of
conditional use that went

61
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,280
before this board in July for
the June Street apartments

62
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,240
which is gonna be B, that's noted here.

63
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,240
Also previous to that, beginning
of the year in January,

64
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,740
we note here on C, we actually
brought before the PAB

65
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,868
the redevelopment of that property.

66
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:19,830
The larger building that
you see there will remain,

67
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,070
but the smaller buildings
have been demolished

68
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,770
because they're in active
construction right now.

69
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,240
And what they're
developing is a three story

70
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,530
development that will house

71
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,530
as a more stable types of
multi-family affordable housing

72
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,410
for those that are
coming out of treatment.

73
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,920
This is owned by the
Park Place Mental Health.

74
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,250
So that building will be
more of a permanent type

75
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,030
of housing as the, as they
go through transitional

76
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,630
and go through the pro
process of rehabilitation.

77
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,000
Also of note that I don't
have highlighted here

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,970
further east where you
see Altman and Rose Avenue

79
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,070
you see a little roundabout that's also

80
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,680
active construction that
you see, that is also

81
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
now going to be apartments.

82
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,140
I think they have it
as an Allen Apartments.

83
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,240
That is the first
development, the first phase

84
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,960
of development for that
property that used to have,

85
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,670
some of you are are from around here,

86
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,569
used to be the Beaumont Middle School

87
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:21,720
and before then the county,

88
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,330
excuse me, had some offices there.

89
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,060
But that is being redeveloped
as the first phase

90
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,500
as multi-family apartments with
opportunities for commercial

91
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,180
out parcels along the frontage
of Martin Luther King.

92
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,040
So I just wanted to give y'all up to date

93
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,250
of all this different
development that is occurring

94
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,083
within this general area.

95
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,640
And I did a little summary
of that in the paragraph,

96
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,690
the second paragraph of the staff report.

97
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,370
Going back to the
conditional use application

98
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,610
before us, reporting documentation,

99
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,110
go ahead and and pull this up.

100
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,340
Again it's gonna be three units.

101
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,830
The town home units
are meeting our minimum

102
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,050
living area requirement
that actually exceeds

103
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,870
that for a town home development.

104
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,300
The units A and B that you see there

105
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,980
includes the two car garage.

106
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,130
The one on the the right
will be a one car garage.

107
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,270
It actually exemplifies

108
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,450
again what we're trying to
do is to introduce a variety

109
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,970
of different housing
types within this area.

110
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,840
And I think we do within the
downtown area too as well,

111
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,843
a different variety of
different housing opportunities.

112
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:50,820
Also include as well,
like I mentioned here

113
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,883
that it exceeds minimum
living area requirements.

114
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,190
Staff will continue to work

115
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,250
with the applicant as it
moves towards construction.

116
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,280
There'll be some revisions
on the elevations

117
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,780
at least we spoke with the applicant

118
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,910
of doing some adjustments to the different

119
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,470
the windows and all of that.

120
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,720
So we'll do some further adjustments

121
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,880
to the elevations, but at this time

122
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,460
staff is recommending approval, subject

123
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,400
to the five conditions that were listed

124
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,250
in the staff report.

125
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,640
I'm here to answer any questions

126
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,960
and also the applicant.

127
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,930
- [Robert] Board questions
or comments for the city?

128
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,380
If not, we'd like to
hear from the applicant.

129
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,770
If the applicant would
like to say a few words,

130
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,500

145
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,090
and we are going to subdivide
this property in a simple

146
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,940

154
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,427
- [Willimae] Good evening, my
name is Williemae Prettigar.

155
00:07:51,427 --> 00:07:54,423
I live at 416 North Billingham.

156
00:07:55,793 --> 00:07:59,250
I'm interested in knowing what,

157
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,970
where's the parking lot
for this development.

158
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,970
Also it will there be a concrete fencing,

159
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,640
because I own property
adjacent to this lot

160
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,630
behind me and on the side of me.

161
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:22,350
[Robert] Okay, thank you.

162
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,900
Brenda, would you like to address that?

163
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,733
Thank you ma'am.

164
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,990
- [Brenda] So on the screen,
because there'll be townhomes,

165
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,270
the parking will be in the driveway.

166
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,640
Two of the units will
have a two car garage,

167
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,940
and there'll be a driveway.

168
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,490
So there won't be a parking lot.

169
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,110
It'll be like a townhome,

170
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,200
where each of the units
will have a driveway.

171
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,783
I think there's another depiction here.

172
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,087
(audience member coughs)

173
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:01,890
Yeah, that's a bit a better
picture there to show how

174
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,290
long the length of the driveways,

175
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,590
so the parking will all
be within the driveways.

176
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,110
And then the other question was

177
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,090
about the concrete?

178
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,097
- [Williemae] Yes, concrete fencing.

179
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:19,597
See I, my property, it's a
lot being, because I talked

180
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:26,654
to one of the surveyors, when
he was out there surveying,

181
00:09:26,786 --> 00:09:30,999
and there posed to be three
lots that's feeding together

182
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:34,807
plus a vacant lot on the
side of when you come

183
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,390
off of June Street.

184
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,630
- [Brenda] So at this
time they're not required

185
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,130
to provide any type

186
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,900
of a perimeter wall because
if you reference the A,

187
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,640
which is the subject property

188
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,640
behind that property are town homes.

189
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,770
So it's the same type product.

190
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,310
So there's town homes
existing off of King Street.

191
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,510
The town homes on King,

192
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,960
the only difference is
that they're rear loading,

193
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,640
they load to towards the back.

194
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,190
These town homes will have the entrances

195
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,180
along June Street.

196
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,270
So because the two are
the same, they're not

197
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,720
gonna be required to put
any type of wall or fencing.

198
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,050
It would be voluntary for
each of the individuals.

199
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,390
Once the lots are sold,

200
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,300
if the individual property
owners would want to put

201
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,560
in any type of fencing.

202
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,947
- [Williemae] Also are these
townhomes gonna be rental

203
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:38,220
or property owners?

204
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,040
- [Brenda] It's gonna be
up to the property owner

205
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,190
whether or not it could be rentals or not.

206
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,090
For as far as with the
city, their fee simple.

207
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,700
The only thing is that they
cannot be short term rental,

208
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,963
but it can be rental.

209
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,620
Short term rental meaning that it's

210
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,403
it has to be, it cannot
be 30 days or less.

211
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:02,608
- [Robert] So it couldn't
be used for like an Airbnb.

212
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:03,441
- [Brenda] It could not.

213
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:05,970
It's not within the short
term rental overlay.

214
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,123
It has to be a minimum of a
month to month type of lease.

215
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,800
- [Robert] Alright, thank you.

216
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,670
Do we have any other public comments?

217
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,293
Any other public comments?

218
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:22,053
If not, do we have any
motions from the board?

219
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:24,237
- [Melissa] Calling for motion to approve.

220
00:11:24,237 --> 00:11:25,493
- [Robert] Melissa
Thacker, motion to approve.

221
00:11:25,493 --> 00:11:29,220
We have second, Robert
Capp, any discussion?

222
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,704
Yes.

223
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:32,670
- [Robert Capp] I guess
specifically the packet suggested

224
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,963
a conditional approval.

225
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,000
Is that a different action

226
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,819
that we would take besides
just making approval, or?

227
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:41,067
That's the same, okay.

228
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:44,340
- [Brenda] Accepting, your
approving with the conditions

229
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,459
specified.

230
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:48,787
Unless you want to do otherwise.

231
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,680
- [Robert] Okay, any other discussion?

232
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,470
If not all in favor, please say aye.

233
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,303
- [Board] Aye.

234
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:57,570
- [Robert] Opposed, please say no.

235
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,403
Hearing none.

236
00:11:58,403 --> 00:11:59,940
Motion carries.

237
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,940
Item is approved, and
public hearings discussion.

238
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,583
Dear Chairman Board,

239
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:11,310
actually I do have a question
going back to the minutes.

240
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,483
And other than my one thing
about the misspelling,

241
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,650
maybe this is me just
misunderstanding 'cause I

242
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,340
thought about this after
we already approved it.

243
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,960
Back in the item where
we had the future land

244
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,613
use designation from county low dense LDR,

245
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,990
and I know Melissa had abstained.

246
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,670
Am I looking at this incorrectly,

247
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,170
That at the bottom where it
says "Aye," it has Melissa

248
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,696
under the "Aye," or am I
looking at that incorrectly?

249
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:47,580
- [Melissa] Yeah that's incorrect.

250
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,900
- [Robert] That is incorrect.

251
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,250
So how do we go about amending this,

252
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,320
having already approved the minutes?

253
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,980
Do we make a motion to
amend the previously

254
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,940
approved minutes?

255
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,490
- [Melissa] You can
make a motion to amend.

256
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,323
- [Robert] Okay.

257
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:05,945
- [Melissa] And it will
come back to the board

258
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:07,328
at the next meeting.

259
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,940
- [Robert] At the next meeting, okay.

260
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,940
So we can't actually reapprove the minutes

261
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:16,007
at this meeting or-

262
00:13:18,962 --> 00:13:22,067
- [Melissa] I mean, you, yeah,

263
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,390
I mean I think it's better
if we bring it back.

264
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,000
- [Robert] Okay, so
technically it's a vote

265
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,960
that is then announced
to the public in advance?

266
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,460
Okay so-

267
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,570
- [Melissa] And it will
be, the correct ones

268
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,440
will be published

269
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,010
with our agenda packet for
the next meeting as well.

270
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:42,180
So why don't we just do
an, an order, I mean, sorry

271
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:47,180
a motion to vacate the
approval of the minutes.

272
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,590
- [Robert] Okay, yeah,
I'd like to make a motion

273
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,030
to vacate the approval

274
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,250
the previous approval of the minutes.

275
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,960
And actually before I
follow through with that

276
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,510
I wanna make sure on the other
one there was the abstention

277
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,803
that that also doesn't
reflect her with an I.

278
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:09,480
If anybody can help me find that.

279
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,313
Does it show that?

280
00:14:10,313 --> 00:14:11,828
Okay, all right yeah.

281
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:16,828
So I make a motion to
vacate the previously

282
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,679
approved minutes.

283
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,590
Do we have a second?

284
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,162
- [Robert Capp] Yes sir.

285
00:14:21,162 --> 00:14:21,995
- [Robert] We have a second.

286
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,363
Alex, any discussion?

287
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,619
All in favor, please say aye.

288
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:27,660
- [Board] Aye.

289
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,310
- [Robert] Opposed, please say no.

290
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,246
Hearing none.

291
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:32,460
Motion minutes are vacated.

292
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,969
Sorry, I didn't catch that earlier.

293
00:14:34,969 --> 00:14:36,641
- [Melissa] That's a good catch.

294
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:37,474
Thank you for that.

295
00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:38,474
- [Robert] That's an important item.

296
00:14:38,474 --> 00:14:41,373
Okay, anything else from
any other board members?

297
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,150
If not, do we have motion to adjourn?

298
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,253
Motion to adjourn.

299
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,086
Melissa Packard.

300
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,059
We have second?

301
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:48,892
- [Diana] Second.

302
00:14:48,892 --> 00:14:49,725
- [Robert] Second from Diana.

303
00:14:49,725 --> 00:14:50,880
All in favor, please say aye.

304
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,713
- [Board] Aye.

305
00:14:51,713 --> 00:14:53,280
- [Robert] Aye, opposed, please say no.

306
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,750
The meeting is adjourned at 6:14.

307
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,583
Thank you.

308
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,090
So should I sign this or no, not sign it.

309
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,890
Okay, I'll just give it back to you.
