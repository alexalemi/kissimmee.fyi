1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,040
(people chattering)

2
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:10,350
- Meeting to order.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,517
Welcome, everyone.

4
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,240
Yeah. Hi.

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,830
Thanks.

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,510
Always call me when I mess something up.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,220
I have no shame in that.

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,450
Please tell me.

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,587
Please stand for the Pledge of Allegiance

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,400
And a moment of silence.

11
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:47,499
- I pledge allegiance.

12
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:50,663
- [Everybody] To the flag of
the United States of America

13
00:00:50,663 --> 00:00:53,218
and to Republic for which it stands,

14
00:00:53,218 --> 00:00:56,404
one nation under God, indivisible,

15
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:58,847
with liberty and justice for all

16
00:00:58,847 --> 00:00:59,680
- Thank you.

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,180
You may be seated.

18
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:08,070
And we have no minutes,
correct, to approve?

19
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,903
- Yes.

20
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:09,736
- Okay.

21
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,420
- Remembering that we have
to correct the minutes.

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,710
So for the next agenda,

23
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,823
we'll probably have three sets of minutes

24
00:01:15,823 --> 00:01:18,933
because we had to
correct the previous one,

25
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:22,440
and the one that we had before

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,810
and now we're gonna have
minutes for this item.

27
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,643
- Right, right.

28
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:27,030
- Or for this meeting, sorry.

29
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,863
- Okay.

30
00:01:27,863 --> 00:01:29,250
And old business, nothing there?

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,303
New business?

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,760
- Yes.

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,090
This is a conditional
use with site plan waiver

34
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,180
for an educational
service, vocational school

35
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,350
at 3357 West Vine Street.

36
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,650
If need be, I can go ahead
and pull up the diagrams

37
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,753
that are exhibits as I go through this.

38
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,293
They're currently requesting-

39
00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:52,890
- Can I pause you for a second

40
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,520
so I don't forget this, which
I have a tendency to do?

41
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,080
I'm gonna ask all board members

42
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,980
if you have any conflicts of
interest with this agenda item

43
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,020
or have had any ex parte communications

44
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,540
or done any research on your
own, anything like that,

45
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,640
please let that be known.

46
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,473
Thank you.

47
00:02:09,473 --> 00:02:10,306
Sorry, Brenda.

48
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:11,370
No, you're fine.

49
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,550
- This is for a educational
service for a vocational school,

50
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,910
the KCBS Advance Academy.

51
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,500
It is a vocational school

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,010
for comprehensive support education

53
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,250
for children on the autistic spectrum.

54
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,253
- Oh, well then, here, let me ask Colony,

55
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,910
because I am on the board of directors

56
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,340
of the Opportunity Center of
the nonprofit in Kissimmee

57
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,640
that works with adults with
developmental disabilities.

58
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,020
I have a son who's autistic.

59
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,460
Is that any sort of...

60
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,510
Okay.

61
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,330
Putting it out there for the record.

62
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,163
Sorry, go ahead.

63
00:02:46,163 --> 00:02:46,996
- No, you're fine.

64
00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:48,180
This is good.

65
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,560
- The vocational school,

66
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,050
there's an exhibit with the documents

67
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,000
will include just Suite
105 on the first floor.

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,360
There's about 3,200 square feet

69
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,303
within Suite 105 that they will occupy.

70
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,890
Total maximum of students
will be 30 students.

71
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,080
And then with the maximum employees

72
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,080
of six instructors,
teachers within this 105.

73
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,150
I also wanna point out
with the adjacent suite,

74
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,260
currently with the current
location in St. Cloud,

75
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,160
the students also have
additional behavioral

76
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,900
analysis therapy at the Kids
Corner Behavioral Services.

77
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,550
Part of the reason why that they want

78
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,920
to include the vocational school here

79
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,020
is to make it a lot easier

80
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,270
for the students to have counseling

81
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,360
and further therapy right next door.

82
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,220
The Kids Corner Behavior Services

83
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,050
has been there for a couple of years.

84
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,450
They have maintained a
business license here

85
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,050
with the city of Kissimmee
valid for quite some time.

86
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,480
So having the vocational
school right next door

87
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,520
will provide easier,

88
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,760
actually just combining
curriculum holistic

89
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,370
and a total comprehensive type of support

90
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,870
for these students.

91
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,930
As far as the site, again,
this is a conditional use

92
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,130
with site plan waiver,

93
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,970
meaning that there is no
additional site improvements

94
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,260
that need to be done.

95
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,730
There's adequate parking.

96
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,860
Landscaping has been up to date.

97
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,560
There's no open code
enforcement violations.

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,080
So there's no additional site improvements

99
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,830
that will be needed to
support the vocational school.

100
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,990
We did work with the school district

101
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,180
and with the applicant for quite some time

102
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,810
to make sure that we do have an ordinance

103
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,810
that was passed quite a bit
of 2013 to limit new public

104
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,820
and private schools along
the Vine Street Corridor.

105
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,080
At that time, there was proliferation

106
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,520
of new public and private
schools within shopping malls

107
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,200
within these different areas

108
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,000
that weren't originally
intended to have schools.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,520
There were issues with
circulation or what have you.

110
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,190
So I attached that ordinance

111
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,520
that was approved back in 2013.

112
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,380
However, that ordinance
limited any new public

113
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,750
or private schools until such time

114
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,180
that there was enough of a population,

115
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,450
that population being 2,000 new units

116
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,160
within the Vine Street Corridor

117
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,600
that would create a demand

118
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,570
for new and public and private schools.

119
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,150
However, in working with
the school district,

120
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,990
we find that this is
such a specialized school

121
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,550
that the school district,

122
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,950
which their comments were
included in the backup,

123
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,163
would not have an impact
on the school district.

124
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,560
We felt with that

125
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,520
and also the specialized
vocational nature of that school,

126
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,520
that we could approve this
use subject to the conditions.

127
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,683
One being that it will
only occupy Suite 105,

128
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,380
the other one being that
the school cannot expand

129
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,770
within the building itself.

130
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,120
The other conditions to
transportation vans and buses.

131
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,410
We know that there's a problem

132
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,840
with circulation drop off, pickup,

133
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,320
the drop off and pickup where
the parents have to park

134
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,760
in a parking space.

135
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,290
And at this time, no
transportation, buses or vans

136
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,610
are allowed.

137
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,360
If for some reason in the
future there's demand for it,

138
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,760
we are requiring that a circulation

139
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,480
or plan be submitted
to the city for review

140
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,430
before any types of transportation,

141
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,333
buses or vans are implemented.

142
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,820
Again, because this is a plaza,

143
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,470
the intended use for offices,

144
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,890
we also felt like this was
gonna be a minimal impact

145
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:54,570
to the businesses that are
there being on the first floor.

146
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,350
And last but not least,
the change internally

147
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,510
will require what we call a change of use

148
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,890
with our building department.

149
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,690
So we wanted to make it clear

150
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,550
that if that change of use
building permit was not attained,

151
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,013
that this use would
not stay with the land,

152
00:07:12,118 --> 00:07:14,310
that if that change of occupancy

153
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,620
and meeting the Florida
Building Code standards

154
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,890
cannot be met, then this
use would be null and void.

155
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,770
We do not want to have
it open in the future

156
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,800
for any other types of educational use.

157
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,070
If that is the case, that
individual will have to come back

158
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,440
with a new conditional use application

159
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,650
and we'll bring it back to
the planning advisory board.

160
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,890
So I feel with the conditions
and with the background

161
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,810
and with the current improvements,

162
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,170
we are recommending approval
subject to those conditions.

163
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,660
So I can address any
questions you may have.

164
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,130
And we also have representatives

165
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,150
from the (faintly speaking).

166
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,280
- Board members, any questions for Brenda?

167
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,113
The city?

168
00:07:51,113 --> 00:07:51,946
If not...

169
00:07:51,946 --> 00:07:52,807
Oh, sorry.

170
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:53,640
- I just have a real quick question.

171
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,473
Did you say dance in
the title of the school?

172
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:59,910
- KCBS Advance.

173
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,560
Advance. Advance.

174
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,460
Advance Academy.

175
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,390
- Still a good mission.

176
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,010
I just wasn't sure if I heard dance.

177
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:05,880
- Yes.

178
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,510
- If the applicant would
like to step to the mic

179
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,283
and send a few words to the board.

180
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,920
State your name and your business address

181
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,492
for the record, please.

182
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:18,002
(woman faintly speaking)

183
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:22,091
(woman faintly speaking)

184
00:08:22,091 --> 00:08:23,220
(woman faintly speaking)

185
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,888
- Oh, the current one is in St. Cloud.

186
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:29,370
It is in 317 Commerce Sunset Drive.

187
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,720
It's in the shopping Plaza.

188
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,993
Saint Cloud.

189
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:35,433
- Is there anything you'd
like to say to the board?

190
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,733
- Oh, I'm sorry.

191
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:38,566
My name is (faintly speaking) Rodriguez.

192
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:43,080
I'm one of the directors
of the school, academy.

193
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,000
- This is just an opportunity
for you to address the board.

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,400
If there's anything like
that you'd like to add.

195
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,970
You're not obligated to,

196
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,003
I'm just giving the opportunity.

197
00:08:53,003 --> 00:08:53,967
- As of now, no.

198
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,024
- Okay.

199
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:56,927
- Board, any questions?

200
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:57,810
I have a question.

201
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,730
What ages do you serve?

202
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,773
- Since fifth.

203
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,880
Five years old until fifth grade,

204
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,100
which is when they reached 10 years old.

205
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,380
- So five years old to fifth grade?

206
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,213
- Yes.

207
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:12,900
From kindergarten to fifth grade.

208
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,730
- Okay, so like elementary school?

209
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,563
- Exactly.

210
00:09:15,563 --> 00:09:16,396
- Okay.

211
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:17,229
All right.

212
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:19,140
If the board doesn't have any questions,

213
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,810
would anyone like to
make a motion to approve?

214
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,130
- Motion to approve.

215
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,963
- Okay.

216
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,047
And do we have a second?

217
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:25,880
- I second.

218
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,713
- A second from Melissa.

219
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:28,050
Any discussion?

220
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,160
I will just say thank you
for this and what you do

221
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,340
and your mission because I
have a son who is autistic

222
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,590
and as I said earlier,
I serve on the board

223
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,660
of the Opportunity Center,
which works with adults

224
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,040
with developmental disabilities.

225
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,970
So I think the more
opportunities, no pun intended,

226
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,140
to help our citizens with
special needs families,

227
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,980
the better.

228
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,213
And thank you for that.

229
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,400
With that, all in favor, please say aye.

230
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,170
- Aye.
- Aye.

231
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,003
- Wait a minute.

232
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:00,543
Did I ask for a motion?

233
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,674
I'm sorry.

234
00:10:02,674 --> 00:10:03,510
Sorry.

235
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,350
All in favor, please say, aye.

236
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,760
- Aye.
- Aye.

237
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,530
Opposed, please say no.

238
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,880
Hearing none, motion carries.

239
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,750
Congratulations.

240
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,583
Thank you.

241
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,150
- Thank you.

242
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,941
- And public hearings.

243
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:19,358
(woman faintly speaking)

244
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,540
(woman faintly speaking)

245
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,373
Thank you.

246
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,760
New business public hearing condition.

247
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,593
No, that's not.

248
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:34,590
Okay. Discussion.

249
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,998
Discussion regarding
December 6th and the 20th?

250
00:10:37,998 --> 00:10:38,831
- Yes.

251
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:40,680
We do understand it's the holiday,

252
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,010
so we want to be sure and try to confirm

253
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,000
whether or not we will have
a quorum for the December 6th

254
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,750
or the December 20th PAB.

255
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,033
I know I've received responses

256
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,727
but I wanted to be sure for December 6th,

257
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,320
'cause we need four board members

258
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,217
for the December 6th meeting.

259
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:07,050
- I would not-

260
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,517
- I think you already provided, yes.

261
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:11,550
You and Melissa already
provided your responses already.

262
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,560
Thank you. I appreciate that.

263
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,720
But I just need to make sure

264
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,820
that we will have a
quorum for December 6th.

265
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,010
I think you responded
that you'll be available.

266
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,060
- I'll be available.

267
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,893
- Okay.

268
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:23,210
- And I think I just said, yeah,

269
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,460
I'm available on the sixth.

270
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,293
- Okay.

271
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:27,126
- I am.

272
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:30,090
- So as of right now, we only
have three board members,

273
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,710
so we don't have a quorum.

274
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,510
So what we will do

275
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:38,510
is reach out to Mr. Spalding
and Sylvette too as well,

276
00:11:41,126 --> 00:11:46,082
'cause right now, we don't
have a quorum for December 6th.

277
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:47,296
- And I'm sorry.

278
00:11:47,296 --> 00:11:50,203
Oh, is there a business for the sixth?

279
00:11:50,203 --> 00:11:51,307
(faintly speaking) minutes.

280
00:11:51,307 --> 00:11:52,434
Is there anything else coming up?

281
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:54,043
- No, there's potentially an item

282
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:55,241
that we're trying to schedule.

283
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:59,640
Yeah, an item that we're
trying to schedule in December,

284
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,290
preferably December 6th for that item.

285
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,730
And then December 20th,

286
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,273
I know that's even closer to holidays.

287
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:14,370
I think you confirm Bob and Diana again.

288
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,690
So we just have every-

289
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,523
- I'm just double checking.

290
00:12:16,523 --> 00:12:17,744
- Okay.

291
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:18,577
On the 20th.

292
00:12:18,577 --> 00:12:20,493
- And I think I could
be here too on the 20th.

293
00:12:20,493 --> 00:12:21,326
- Okay.

294
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:25,144
- Yeah, I'm good.

295
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,310
- Okay.

296
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,143
So as of right now,

297
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:31,242
potentially we definitely have
a quorum on December 20th.

298
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:32,498
Okay.

299
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:33,331
All right.

300
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:34,650
And then last but not least,

301
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,940
I also provided to you
the schedule for 2024.

302
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,020
So this is available
online where it says PAB,

303
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,530
those are the planning
advisory board dates for 2024.

304
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,640
The way we have it set up for
our projects that come in,

305
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,140
they first start off with our committee,

306
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,700
that's that DRC on there.

307
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,953
Let me zoom in, Bob, you're squinting.

308
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,400
So wherever it says the PAB,

309
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,860
those are potential planning
advisory board dates.

310
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,200
So I just wanted to
provide them to you again

311
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,190
so we can plan ahead,
especially with the children

312
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,660
during spring break or so.

313
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,830
That way, we can plan ahead

314
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,650
and we can communicate with our applicants

315
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:23,330
whether or not we're gonna
be able to have a quorum.

316
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,223
- Am I reading this correctly?

317
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,820
The first scheduled
meeting is not until March.

318
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,653
Is that?

319
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:37,310
- No, the other meetings in
2024 are on the 2023 standby.

320
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:39,690
- Oh, gotcha, gotcha.

321
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,523
Okay.

322
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,260
- For what it's worth
that I'm not gonna be able

323
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,452
to make cycle three on
April. (faintly speaking)

324
00:13:50,452 --> 00:13:52,380
- Cycle number three?

325
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,213
- Yes.
- Okay.

326
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,270
- This is based on application intake.

327
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,780
So the 2023 schedule
includes the first January

328
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,613
and February.

329
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,460
Cycle number 21 actually
includes the first January

330
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,930
and February PAV dates.

331
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,279
What I'll probably do
is also I'll send this

332
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,770
to you all too as well.

333
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,497
So the first one is (faintly speaking).

334
00:14:41,723 --> 00:14:42,847
January 3rd.

335
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:46,108
Okay.

336
00:14:46,108 --> 00:14:48,150
So cycle number three, we have Alex.

337
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,390
So again, just send us,
communicate with us,

338
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,510
just look it through
it with your schedule,

339
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,673
so that way, we can plan ahead.

340
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,760
- It is breathtaking
how fast the time goes.

341
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,410
- Yes.

342
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,250
Yes.

343
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,432
So what we'll do is...

344
00:15:03,432 --> 00:15:08,400
So the 2024 that we have at the tailwind,

345
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,840
we'll include the early
January and February 2025

346
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,370
planning advisory board date.

347
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,340
We set this up based
on application intake.

348
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,890
So at the end of this, we'll...

349
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:22,714
- Did you say 2025?

350
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,330
(woman faintly speaking)

351
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,353
Did you misspeak?

352
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,903
Oh my gosh.

353
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,220
- So at the end of the 2024,

354
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,600
we'll include those January

355
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,710
and February 2025 planning
advisory board dates.

356
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,684
- Wow.

357
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:39,517
Wow.

358
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,233
- Yup.

359
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,403
(people chattering)

360
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,890
- Anything else?

361
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,120
- Just wondering are we...

362
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,767
Like right now, we're off
cycle with the city com.

363
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,037
- That's at least the first
and the third Wednesday.

364
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:59,010
So that follows. (faintly speaking)

365
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,902
The only thing is we were off this Monday,

366
00:16:01,902 --> 00:16:04,152
'cause of how the calendar.

367
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,892
So normally, we're in sync.

368
00:16:06,892 --> 00:16:07,980
- Okay.

369
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,813
- Yeah.

370
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:09,646
I think they switched it

371
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:11,880
for the budget hearings for something.

372
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,713
No?

373
00:16:12,713 --> 00:16:16,113
(woman faintly speaking)

374
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,387
Yeah.

375
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:20,910
(woman faintly speaking)

376
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,870
Yeah.

377
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,490
Normally, the same week.

378
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,260
That would be especially for me,

379
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,550
Tuesday, the city commission,

380
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,130
and then the next following
day is planning advisory board.

381
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,560
It usually happens during the same week,

382
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,900
but there was an offset for a while

383
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,120
that really confused
me and a lot of staff.

384
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,923
But normally, it's the same week.

385
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:40,643
All right.

386
00:16:40,643 --> 00:16:42,740
So again, just notify us, let us know

387
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,283
so that way we can plan ahead.

388
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,073
That's all I have.

389
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:46,906
- All right.

390
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:49,173
Board members, anything
you wanna bring up?

391
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,810
If not,

392
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,860
I'm wishing everybody a
wonderful Thanksgiving next week.

393
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,260
And do we have a motion to adjourn.

394
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,910
- I make the motion to adjourn.

395
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,990
- Melissa, a motion to adjourn.

396
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:01,950
Do we have a second?

397
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,083
- I second.

398
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,130
- Second, I heard Diane.

399
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,963
Okay.

400
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:07,560
And any discussion about that?

401
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,210
If not, meeting...

402
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,140
All favor, please say, aye.

403
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,160
- Aye.
- Aye.

404
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,993
- Aye.

405
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:12,826
Opposed, please say, no.

406
00:17:12,826 --> 00:17:14,012
Meeting adjourned, 6:17.

407
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:14,845
Thank you.

408
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:15,678
- Thank you.

409
00:17:15,678 --> 00:17:16,511
- So for the December 20th,

410
00:17:16,511 --> 00:17:19,400
so we'll clear you'll bring
in the Christmas cookies, Rob?
