## Major Discussions

### 1. Comprehensive Plan Review Proposal

**Initiator:** Board member (appears to be experienced member)

**Initial Motion:**
- Proposed adding agenda item for next meeting to discuss Chapter 1 (Future Land Use) of the comprehensive plan
- Goal: Systematic chapter-by-chapter review over multiple meetings
- Rationale:
  - New board members need familiarization
  - Board's mandate is to ensure decisions align with comprehensive plan
  - City will be reviewing/updating comprehensive plan in coming 1-2 years
  - Opportunity to discuss potential suggestions for future updates

**Discussion Points:**
- Comprehensive plan is approximately 600-800 pages (1,200 pages with all amendments)
- Board's duty: Ensure decisions comply with city's comprehensive plan
- Breaking up review would be more manageable

**Resolution:**
- Motion was retracted after further discussion
- Agreement to proceed with workshop approach instead (see below)

---

### 2. Board Training and Workshop Planning

**Key Discussion:** Extended conversation about establishing workshops for board education

**Workshop Proposal (Staff Recommendation):**

**Part 1 - Governance and Procedures:**
- Ethics training
- Robert's Rules of Order
- Florida statutes applicable to planning boards
- Florida Sunshine Law requirements
- General board member duties and responsibilities

**Part 2 - Planning and Technical:**
- Comprehensive plan overview
- Correlation between comprehensive plan and zoning
- Land Development Regulations (LDR)
- Different types of applications
- City's application review process
- Staff vetting procedures
- External agency coordination (Toho School Board, KUA, County, etc.)

**Logistical Considerations:**
- Workshops scheduled when no regular agenda items are pending
- Typically 1 hour duration (to avoid information overload)
- Must be held in public forum due to Sunshine Law requirements
- Must be publicly advertised
- Requires minimum of 4 voting members (quorum) to proceed
- Need advance confirmation of attendance for advertising requirements
- Tentative timing: Late August or September 2024
- Multiple workshops can be scheduled as needed (quarterly if desired)

**Participant Input:**

**Aaron Sabino (new board member):**
- Moved to Kissimmee specifically after reading the 50-year comprehensive plan buildout
- Emphasized importance of comprehensive plan knowledge for board effectiveness
- Expressed strong interest in training and getting "up to speed"
- Requested presentation materials/slides
- Concerned about using public meeting time for training when applicants are present
- Asked about Saturday training options

**Rebecca Marin (new board member):**
- Agreed training is important
- Suggested potential for Saturday sessions (staff clarified Sunshine Law requires public forum)

**Board Response:**
- General agreement that workshops are valuable
- Preference expressed for doing training during regular meeting times when no items scheduled
- Acknowledged that workshops must be public and open to general public, not just board

**Staff Clarification:**
- Workshops are educational sessions for both board and public
- No recommendations or decisions made during workshops
- Applications cannot be unduly delayed for training purposes
- Similar to City Commission workshops
- Staff (individual planners) available for one-on-one questions via email between meetings

### 3. Public Access to Comprehensive Plan

**Issue Raised:** Board members requested city make comprehensive plan publicly available online

**Current Situation:**
- Comprehensive plan not readily accessible on city website
- Currently provided upon request (meets legal compliance)
- Aaron Sabino had to email City Manager to obtain copy
- Noted this is unusual - other cities typically have comprehensive plan readily available online

**Comparison:**
- City website currently has links to:
  - City code/community code
  - Downtown CRA comprehensive plan
  - Vine Street CRA comprehensive plan
- But NOT the city's main comprehensive plan

**Request:**
- Add direct PDF link to city comprehensive plan on website
- Make past amendments available as well
- Similar to how other planning documents are currently accessible

**Staff Response:**
- Issue has been noted by city staff and city manager
- Website currently undergoing updates/redevelopment
- IT department aware of request
- Staff will provide ETA on when comprehensive plan will be available online
- May provide interim temporary link before full website rollout
- Staff acknowledged this is reasonable request and will work to make it happen
