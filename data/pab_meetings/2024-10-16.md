The board approved minutes from three previous meetings:

#### July 17, 2024 PAB Meeting Minutes

- **Second:** Alex
- **Result:** Approved (Chair abstained - not present at that meeting)

#### September 4, 2024 PAB Meeting Minutes

**Important Clarification:** Staff explained that minutes from previous meetings were brought back for re-approval because the City Clerk's office clarified that minutes should NOT be verbatim.

### 2. Public Hearing - Conditional Use Application

#### Case Details
- **Location:** 400 Church Street, Unit 109
- **Parcel Size:** Approximately 0.34 acres
- **Zoning:** T5-M (Mixed Use Center Transect)
- **Future Land Use:** MUD (Mixed Use Downtown)
- **Applicant:** Ruben from MBG Traffic (9029 Reflection Point Drive, Windermere, FL 34786)

#### Property History
- Building constructed in 1955
- Previously used as a church (Calvary Assembly of God, St. Luke's Missionary Church)
- Concrete pavement permitted in 1980
- Previously zoned B4 Main Street Commercial before rezoning to T5-M
- Currently houses multiple businesses including Your Holistic Center, LLC and Essential Services for U-Inc

#### Proposal
Request for conditional use with site plan waiver to establish an **online driving school** (educational service establishment).

**Key Features:**
- Primarily an online driving school
- Two computers on-site for individuals without internet access
- Maximum of two students at any given time
- Limited operating hours (until approximately 4:00 PM)
- Occasional on-site visits only; most services provided online
- All modifications are interior only (no exterior changes)

#### Staff Findings
The Development Review Committee (September 9, 2024) found the application compliant with:
- Section 14-5-4(f) - Intent of T5-M zoning
- Section 14-5-6, Table 5-1 - Educational service establishments as conditional use
- Section 14-3-29(c)(2) - Site plan waiver (interior modifications only)
- Section 14-3-29(g)(1-13) - Conditional use review criteria
- Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Element Policy 1292

The building is considered legal non-conforming, and since the conditional use does not expand non-conformity, major parking improvements were not required.

#### Conditions of Approval
1. Approval is for Unit 109 only; cannot be transferred or expanded to another suite without separate PAB approval
2. Business license must be issued within one year or conditional use approval will be revoked
3. Once business license is issued, conditional use remains valid on the parcel
4. If business license lapses for one year, approval becomes void
5. Maximum of two students at any given time
6. No modifications to Toho infrastructure

#### Board Discussion
**Aaron** raised concerns about:
- Proximity restrictions between educational institutions and certain businesses (bars, alcohol sales)
- Whether this could limit future development in the vibrant downtown area
- Florida statutes regarding distance requirements from schools

**Staff Response:**
- This is a vocational/educational service establishment, not a traditional school
- Distance restrictions typically apply to elementary, middle, and high schools
- This establishment would not require Department of Education certification
- Bars and restaurants with alcohol sales can operate nearby without restriction

#### Outcome
- **Motion:** Robert Kaplan moved to approve with conditions
- **Second:** Alex
- **Public Comments:** None
- **Conflicts of Interest:** None declared
- **Result:** Motion carried unanimously

### 3. Board Discussion - PAB Procedures and City Commission Communication

A lengthy and important procedural discussion was initiated by **Alex** regarding how PAB recommendations and amendments are communicated to the City Commission.

#### Background Issue
Alex expressed concerns about a previous case where the PAB had amended a proposal (changing boundaries), but when presented to the City Commission:
- The original proposal map was displayed (not the amended version)
- The PAB's amendment was included in the staff report and stated verbally
- However, no visual representation of the amended boundaries was created
- Alex felt the commissioners may not have fully understood the PAB's deliberations and intent

#### Key Questions Raised
1. How detailed should PAB recommendations be when forwarded to City Commission?
2. What is the best way for PAB to communicate concerns and ensure commissioners understand the board's reasoning?
3. Can PAB members present recommendations directly to City Commission?
4. How can the board ensure its amendments have meaningful impact?

#### Staff and Legal Responses

**Brenda (Staff):**
- Staff must present PAB actions factually to City Commission
- PAB recommendations and conditions are included in staff reports
- PAB amendments are stated verbally and in writing
- Staff cannot "embellish" or add interpretation beyond what the board decided
- Maps showing amended boundaries are not automatically created; original application materials are used

**Kalanit (Legal):**
- PAB members **cannot** represent the board at City Commission meetings
- Individual PAB members speaking at Commission meetings as PAB representatives creates potential legal conflicts
- This could invalidate PAB actions and create liability for the city
- If PAB members speak to Commission, they must do so **as individual citizens only**, not as PAB members
- Making modifications outside of PAB meetings could be grounds for legal challenges by applicants
- Other municipalities follow the same practice - PAB members do not present to commissions

**Chair's Summary:**
When PAB takes action, City Commission receives:
- Factual presentation of what PAB decided
- Staff cannot convey the "passion" or detailed reasoning behind decisions
- Commissioners see "black and white details" rather than the full discussion
- This is simply how the process works

#### Resolution and Conclusions

The board reached consensus on the following going forward:

1. **For PAB Actions:** When amendments are needed to align proposals with the comprehensive plan, the board should make them as detailed and impactful as possible during the PAB meeting itself

2. **For Individual Advocacy:** Board members retain the right to speak at City Commission meetings as individual citizens, but must be very careful NOT to represent themselves as PAB members, which would create conflicts

3. **Communication Limits:** Staff will present PAB recommendations factually in staff reports and verbally, but will not create new visual materials or elaborate beyond the board's stated actions

4. **Democratic Process:** As one member noted, "that is the peril of democracy" - if there's not an educated populace, there cannot be informed decisions by policymakers, but this is a broader societal problem

**Alex's Final Statement:** The discussion made it clear that when PAB feels something doesn't align with the comprehensive plan, commissioners appeared not to understand the PAB's amendments or discussion based on the City Commission meeting he observed, making it "hard to feel though democracy could play its role."

## Action Items

No specific action items were identified beyond the normal processing of the approved conditional use application.

---

## Adjournment

- **Motion to Adjourn:** Alex
- **Second:** Aaron
- **Time:** 6:48 PM

## Notes

This meeting highlighted important procedural limitations in how advisory board recommendations are communicated to final decision-makers. While PAB provides detailed review and can add conditions or amendments, the translation of those deliberations to City Commission is necessarily condensed to factual summaries in staff reports. Board members expressed concern about this limitation but were informed that current procedures align with legal requirements and best practices to avoid conflicts and liability.
