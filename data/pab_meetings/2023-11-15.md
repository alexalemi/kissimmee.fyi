## Key Decisions Made

### Approval with Conditions

**Vote:** Unanimously approved

**Motion:** Made by board member (name not clear in transcript)
**Second:** Melissa
**Result:** All in favor, motion carried

### Conditions of Approval:

1. **Limited to Suite 105 Only:** The school can only occupy Suite 105 and cannot expand within the building

2. **No Transportation Services Initially:** No buses or vans are permitted for student drop-off/pickup at this time. Parents must park in parking spaces and walk students in/out.

3. **Future Transportation Plan Required:** If transportation services (buses/vans) are needed in the future, a circulation plan must be submitted to the city for review and approval before implementation

4. **Building Permit Required:** A change of use building permit must be obtained from the building department. The conditional use approval is contingent on meeting Florida Building Code standards. If the change of occupancy permit cannot be obtained, the conditional use becomes null and void.

5. **Non-Transferable:** This conditional use approval does not run with the land. Any future educational use at this location would require a new conditional use application to be brought back to the Planning Advisory Board.

## Notable Discussions and Concerns

### Conflict of Interest Disclosure
The Chair disclosed that he serves on the board of directors of the Opportunity Center of Kissimmee (a nonprofit working with adults with developmental disabilities) and has a son who is autistic. Legal counsel confirmed this was not a conflict of interest.

### Historical Context - 2013 Ordinance
Staff member Brenda provided important background on a 2013 ordinance that limited new public and private schools along the Vine Street Corridor. Key points:

- The ordinance was passed due to proliferation of schools in shopping malls and areas not originally intended for schools
- Issues included circulation problems and inadequate infrastructure
- The ordinance required 2,000 new residential units in the corridor before new schools would be permitted
- **Exception for This Application:** After consultation with the school district, staff determined this specialized vocational school would not impact the school district and therefore qualified for approval despite the ordinance

### Site Plan Waiver Justification
The application included a site plan waiver because:
- No additional site improvements are needed
- Adequate parking already exists
- Landscaping is up to date
- No open code enforcement violations
- The existing plaza infrastructure can support the use with minimal impact

### Community Benefit
The Chair expressed support for the application, noting the importance of providing opportunities for citizens with special needs and their families.
