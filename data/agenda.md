# Planning Advisory Board Agenda Addition Process
## Comprehensive Analysis Report (June 2023 - November 2024)

---

## Executive Summary

Analysis of 15 Planning Advisory Board (PAB) meetings from June 2023 through November 2024 reveals limited formal discussion about procedures for adding items to the agenda. Only 4 out of 15 meetings (27%) contained substantive discussion about agenda processes, with the most comprehensive explanation occurring on May 15, 2024.

**Key Findings:**
- The formal process for adding agenda items is not well-documented in meeting discussions
- Board members are encouraged to work through staff rather than independently proposing agenda items
- A three-day advance publication requirement exists for substantive items
- Informal "general discussion items" can be added without formal motions
- The process appears to prioritize staff-initiated items over board member-initiated proposals

**Documentation Gap:** The majority of meetings (73%) contained no discussion about how to add items to the agenda, suggesting either that the process is well-understood by participants or that it may not be clearly established.

## Detailed Meeting-by-Meeting Analysis

### Meetings with Agenda Addition Discussions

#### 1. September 6, 2023
**Timestamps:** 00:41:41 - 00:42:31
**Context:** Staff explanation during Board Member Comments

**Summary:**
Staff provided an overview of agenda distribution procedures but did not explicitly explain how to request new items:
- Agendas are distributed by Friday for weekend review
- Board members can reach out to staff before meetings with questions (with instruction not to use Reply All)
- Cancellation notices are sent if no agenda items are available
- Staff committed to timely agenda distribution

**Limitation:** This discussion focused on agenda receipt and review, not on the process for proposing or adding new items.

#### 2. December 20, 2023
**Timestamps:** 00:16:15, 01:07:14 - 01:07:28, 01:09:35 - 01:09:54
**Context:** Multiple points during meeting

**Summary:**
Limited procedural discussions revealed:
- Public comments on agenda items can be submitted and are read aloud during meetings
- Revisions can be made to agendas after initial distribution
- Chairman inquired about items for the next meeting

**Limitation:** No formal explanation of how board members or the public can request items be added to future agendas.

#### 3. May 15, 2024 (Most Comprehensive Discussion)
**Timestamps:** 00:10:34 - 00:10:52, 00:37:04 - 00:37:10, 00:41:06 - 00:42:32
**Context:** Discussion about comprehensive plan amendments and agenda procedures

**Summary:**
This meeting provided the most detailed explanation of agenda processes:

**Publication Requirements:**
- Substantive items require 3-day advance publication
- Items requiring formal review must "come through Planning Advisory Board"

**Process for Proposing Comprehensive Plan Amendments** (primary discussion 00:41:06 - 00:42:32):
1. **Initial Step:** Board members should reach out to staff with proposals
2. **Staff Review:** Staff reviews proposals to determine if a policy is missing or if there was an oversight
3. **Vetting Requirement:** Staff-level vetting is required before bringing items to the Board
4. **Board Member Limitation:** Board members should not propose changes "of their own volition"
5. **Alternative Channel:** Board members can bring issues to City Commission via public comments or direct communication

**Key Implication:** This discussion suggests a staff-mediated process where board members do not have direct authority to add items to the PAB agenda without staff approval.

#### 4. July 17, 2024
**Timestamps:** 00:06:08 - 00:06:29, 00:06:34 - 00:07:04
**Context:** Board member attempted to add comprehensive plan discussion to next meeting

**Summary:**
A board member's attempt to add an item clarified the distinction between types of agenda additions:

**Two Categories of Agenda Items:**
1. **General Discussion Items:** Can be added without formal motion
2. **Official Agenda Items Requiring Action:** Need motion process

**Outcome:** The board member retracted their motion after learning about a planned workshop on the topic.

**Key Insight:** This exchange demonstrated that informal discussions can be added more easily than items requiring formal board action.

## Key Findings

### 1. Staff-Mediated Process
The clearest guidance (May 15, 2024) indicates that board members should work through staff rather than independently adding items:
- Initial proposals go to staff first
- Staff conducts review and vetting
- Staff determines whether items warrant board consideration
- Direct board member initiation is discouraged

### 2. Publication Requirements
- Three-day advance publication required for substantive items
- Agendas typically distributed by Friday for weekend review
- Revisions possible after initial distribution

### 3. Two-Tier System
The July 17, 2024 discussion revealed two pathways:
- **Informal Route:** General discussion items (no motion required)
- **Formal Route:** Action items (motion required)

### 4. Alternative Channels
Board members have options beyond PAB agenda additions:
- Direct communication with City Commission
- Public comments at Commission meetings
- Staff consultation before formal proposals

### 5. Limited Public Access Information
Only one mention of public participation in agenda-setting:
- Public can submit comments on existing agenda items
- No clear process described for public requests to add items

## Patterns and Changes Over Time

### Timeline Analysis

**Early Period (June - December 2023):**
- Minimal discussion of agenda procedures
- September 2023: First substantive discussion focused on agenda distribution, not addition
- December 2023: Brief mentions of agenda revisions

**Mid Period (February - May 2024):**
- February and March: No discussions
- May 2024: **Watershed moment** - most comprehensive explanation of process, particularly regarding comprehensive plan amendments

**Recent Period (July - November 2024):**
- July 2024: Practical application of process when board member attempted to add item
- August - November 2024: No further discussions despite active meeting schedule

### Observable Patterns

1. **Reactive Rather Than Proactive:** Discussions about agenda processes emerged when questions arose, not as routine orientation

2. **Emphasis on Staff Control:** Growing clarity (especially May and July 2024) that staff serves as gatekeeper for agenda items

3. **Lack of Formal Documentation:** No evidence of written procedures being referenced or distributed

4. **Learning Through Practice:** The July 2024 exchange showed real-time learning about informal vs. formal agenda additions

5. **No Systematic Onboarding:** Despite board member changes over 18 months, no evidence of systematic orientation about agenda procedures

## Gaps and Unanswered Questions

Based on the analysis, several questions remain unanswered:

1. **Written Procedures:** Is there a written policy document governing PAB agenda additions?

2. **Public Requests:** What is the formal process for members of the public to request agenda items?

3. **Timeframes:** What are the specific deadlines for requesting agenda additions?

4. **Appeal Process:** If staff declines to add a board member's proposed item, is there an appeal mechanism?

5. **Formal vs. Informal:** What criteria distinguish items that can be added informally from those requiring formal motions?

6. **Emergency Items:** Is there a process for adding urgent items outside the normal three-day publication window?

7. **Board Authority:** Does the board have collective authority to overrule staff decisions about agenda content?

---

## Recommendations for Clarity

Based on the identified gaps in documentation and discussion:

1. **Develop Written Guidelines:** Create and distribute a clear, written policy on agenda item requests

2. **Regular Orientation:** Include agenda procedures in new board member orientation

3. **Annual Review:** Schedule annual review of procedural matters, including agenda-setting

4. **Public Documentation:** Make agenda request procedures publicly available on the city website

5. **Clear Timelines:** Establish and communicate specific deadlines for agenda item requests

6. **Formalize Categories:** Clearly define what constitutes "general discussion" vs. "action items"

7. **Transparency in Decisions:** If staff declines to add requested items, provide written explanation

---

## Conclusion

Over 18 months of PAB meetings, the process for adding items to the agenda has been discussed in only 27% of meetings, with substantive explanations emerging primarily in response to specific questions or situations. The May 15, 2024 meeting provided the most comprehensive guidance, establishing a staff-mediated process that requires board members to work through staff rather than independently proposing agenda items.

The current process appears to prioritize staff control over agenda content, with board members having limited direct authority to add items. While this approach may serve administrative efficiency, the lack of clear, documented procedures and infrequent discussion of these processes suggests an opportunity for improved transparency and member education.

Future improvements should focus on formalizing and documenting the agenda-setting process to ensure all board members and the public understand how to effectively participate in shaping PAB discussions and decisions.
