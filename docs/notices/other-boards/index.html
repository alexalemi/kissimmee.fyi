<div class="full-text-content">ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF ZONING ADJUSTMENTMEETING NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARINGNotice is hereby given that the Orange County Board of Zoning Adjustment (BZA) shall  consider the requests listed below at their December 4, 2025, public hearing. Public hearings will be held in the County Commissioners Chambers located on the first floor of the Orange County Administration Building, 201 S. Rosalind Avenue beginning at  9:00 a.m. or as soon thereafter as possible.  Please be advised that Section 286.0105, Florida Statutes, states that if a person  decides to appeal any decision made by a board, agency, or commission with respect to  any matter considered at a meeting or hearing he will need a record of the proceedings,  and that for such purpose, he may need to ensure a verbatim record of the proceedings  is made, which record includes the testimony and evidence upon which the appeal is to  be based.  The notated public hearing is quasi-judicial in nature. As such, any verbal or written  communication with a member of the Board of Zoning Adjustment prior to todays quasi judicial hearing should be disclosed on the record or made a part of the record during  the public hearing by or on behalf of the party who communicated with the Board  member to allow any interested party an opportunity to inquire about or respond to such  communication. Failure to disclose any such communication may place the party who  ultimately prevails at the quasi-judicial hearing at risk of having the Boards decision  overturned in a court of law due to prejudice against the party who was not privy to the  ex parte communication.
