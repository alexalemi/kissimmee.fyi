Rosalind Avenue beginning at  9:00 a.m. or as soon thereafter as possible.  Please be advised that Section 286.0105, Florida Statutes, states that if a person  decides to appeal any decision made by a board, agency, or commission with respect to  any matter considered at a meeting or hearing he will need a record of the proceedings,  and that for such purpose, he may need to ensure a verbatim record of the proceedings  is made, which record includes the testimony and evidence upon which the appeal is to  be based.  The notated public hearing is quasi-judicial in nature. As such, any verbal or written  communication with a member of the Board of Zoning Adjustment prior to todays quasi judicial hearing should be disclosed on the record or made a part of the record during  the public hearing by or on behalf of the party who communicated with the Board  member to allow any interested party an opportunity to inquire about or respond to such  communication. Failure to disclose any such communication may place the party who  ultimately prevails at the quasi-judicial hearing at risk of having the Boards decision  overturned in a court of law due to prejudice against the party who was not privy to the  ex parte communication.

The special assessments may be payable at the same time and in the same manner as are ad-valorem taxes and collected pursuant to Chapter 197, Florida Statutes; provided, however, that in the event the uniform non ad-valorem assessment method of collecting the Assessments is not available to the District in any year, or if determined by the District to be in its best interest, the Assessments may be collected as is otherwise permitted by law, including but not limited to by direct bill.  The decision to collect special assessments by any particular method  e.g., on the tax roll or by direct bill  does not mean that such method will be used to collect special assessments in future years, and the District reserves the right to select collection methods in any given year, regardless of past practices.	5.	DESIGNATING THE LANDS UPON WHICH THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS SHALL BE LEVIED.  The Assessments securing the Project shall be levied on the lands within the District, including the Boundary Amendment Parcel, as described in Exhibit B, and as further designated by the assessment plat hereinafter provided for.	6.

As a point of clarification, Resolution 2023-12 remains in full force and effect, and the intent of this Resolution is solely to add the Boundary Amendment Parcel to the property subject to the Assessments originally levied pursuant to Resolution 2023-12.11.	SEVERABILITY.  If any section or part of a section of this resolution be declared invalid or unconstitutional, the validity, force, and effect of any other section or part of a section of this resolution shall not thereby be affected or impaired unless it clearly appears that such other section or part of a section of this resolution is wholly or necessarily dependent upon the section or part of a section so held to be invalid or unconstitutional.  	12.
