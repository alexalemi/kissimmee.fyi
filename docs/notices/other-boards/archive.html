<div class="full-text-content">ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF ZONING ADJUSTMENTMEETING NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARINGNotice is hereby given that the Orange County Board of Zoning Adjustment (BZA) shall  consider the requests listed below at their December 4, 2025, public hearing. Public hearings will be held in the County Commissioners Chambers located on the first floor of the Orange County Administration Building, 201 S. Rosalind Avenue beginning at  9:00 a.m. or as soon thereafter as possible.  Please be advised that Section 286.0105, Florida Statutes, states that if a person  decides to appeal any decision made by a board, agency, or commission with respect to  any matter considered at a meeting or hearing he will need a record of the proceedings,  and that for such purpose, he may need to ensure a verbatim record of the proceedings  is made, which record includes the testimony and evidence upon which the appeal is to  be based.  The notated public hearing is quasi-judicial in nature. As such, any verbal or written  communication with a member of the Board of Zoning Adjustment prior to todays quasi judicial hearing should be disclosed on the record or made a part of the record during  the public hearing by or on behalf of the party who communicated with the Board  member to allow any interested party an opportunity to inquire about or respond to such  communication. Failure to disclose any such communication may place the party who  ultimately prevails at the quasi-judicial hearing at risk of having the Boards decision  overturned in a court of law due to prejudice against the party who was not privy to the  ex parte communication.

DESIGNATING THE NATURE AND LOCATION OF IMPROVEMENTS.  The nature and general location of, and plans and specifications for the Project, including the portion that relates to the Boundary Amendment Parcel, are described in Exhibit A, which is on file at the District Records Office.  Exhibit B is also on file and available for public inspection at the same location.  	4.	DECLARING THE TOTAL ESTIMATED COST OF THE IMPROVEMENTS, THE PORTION TO BE PAID BY ASSESSMENTS, AND THE MANNER AND TIMING IN WHICH THE ASSESSMENTS ARE TO BE PAID.  A.	The total estimated cost of the Project, including the portion that relates to the Boundary Amendment Parcel, is $185,929,000 (Estimated Cost), with the estimated cost of the portion of the Project related to the Boundary Amendment Parcel being $70,866,000 (Boundary Amendment Estimated Cost).  B.	The Assessments as they relate to the Boundary Amendment Parcel are anticipated to be levied and allocated in an amount to fund only a portion of the Boundary Amendment Estimated Cost.  Specifically, as set forth in more detail in Exhibit B, the Assessments to be levied and allocated to the Boundary Amendment Parcel will defray approximately $240,000,000, which is the anticipated maximum par value of any bonds and which includes a portion of the Boundary Amendment Estimated Cost, as well as other financing-related costs, as set forth in Exhibit B, and which is in addition to interest and collection costs.  On an annual basis, the Assessments to be levied and allocated to the Boundary Amendment Parcel will defray no more than approximately $92,300,000 per year, again as set forth in Exhibit B.  C.	The manner in which the Assessments shall be apportioned and paid is set forth in Exhibit B, as may be modified by supplemental assessment resolutions.  The Assessments will constitute a master lien, which may be imposed without further public hearing in one or more separate liens each securing a series of bonds, and each as determined by supplemental assessment resolution.  With respect to each lien securing a series of bonds, the special assessments shall be paid in not more than (30) thirty yearly installments.  The special assessments may be payable at the same time and in the same manner as are ad-valorem taxes and collected pursuant to Chapter 197, Florida Statutes; provided, however, that in the event the uniform non ad-valorem assessment method of collecting the Assessments is not available to the District in any year, or if determined by the District to be in its best interest, the Assessments may be collected as is otherwise permitted by law, including but not limited to by direct bill.  The decision to collect special assessments by any particular method  e.g., on the tax roll or by direct bill  does not mean that such method will be used to collect special assessments in future years, and the District reserves the right to select collection methods in any given year, regardless of past practices.	5.	DESIGNATING THE LANDS UPON WHICH THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS SHALL BE LEVIED.  The Assessments securing the Project shall be levied on the lands within the District, including the Boundary Amendment Parcel, as described in Exhibit B, and as further designated by the assessment plat hereinafter provided for.	6.

Pursuant to Section 170.06, Florida Statutes, the District Manager has caused to be made a preliminary assessment roll, in accordance with the method of assessment described in Exhibit B hereto, which shows the lots and lands assessed, the amount of benefit to and the assessment against each lot or parcel of land and the number of annual installments into which the assessment may be divided, which assessment roll is hereby adopted and approved as the Districts preliminary assessment roll.  	8.	DIRECTION TO PROVIDE NOTICE OF THE HEARINGS. The Board shall adopt a subsequent resolution to fix a time and place at which the owners of property to be assessed or any other persons interested therein may appear before the Board and be heard as to the propriety and advisability of the assessments or the making of the Improvements, the cost thereof, the manner of payment therefore, or the amount thereof to be assessed against each property as improved.  	9.

CONFLICTS.  All resolutions or parts thereof in conflict herewith are, to the extent of such conflict, superseded and repealed.  As a point of clarification, Resolution 2023-12 remains in full force and effect, and the intent of this Resolution is solely to add the Boundary Amendment Parcel to the property subject to the Assessments originally levied pursuant to Resolution 2023-12.11.	SEVERABILITY.  If any section or part of a section of this resolution be declared invalid or unconstitutional, the validity, force, and effect of any other section or part of a section of this resolution shall not thereby be affected or impaired unless it clearly appears that such other section or part of a section of this resolution is wholly or necessarily dependent upon the section or part of a section so held to be invalid or unconstitutional.  	12.

AUTHORITY FOR THIS RESOLUTION; INCORPORATION OF RECITALS.  This Resolution is adopted pursuant to the provisions of Florida law, including without limitation Chapters 170, 190 and 197, Florida Statutes.  The recitals stated above are incorporated herein and are adopted by the Board as true and correct statements.  2.	DECLARATION OF ASSESSMENTS.  The Board hereby declares that, with respect to the Boundary Amendment Parcel, the Board has determined to undertake the Project and to defray a portion of the cost thereof by the Assessments.   3.	DESIGNATING THE NATURE AND LOCATION OF IMPROVEMENTS.  The nature and general location of, and plans and specifications for the Project, including the portion that relates to the Boundary Amendment Parcel, are described in Exhibit A, which is on file at the District Records Office.  Exhibit B is also on file and available for public inspection at the same location.  	4.	DECLARING THE TOTAL ESTIMATED COST OF THE IMPROVEMENTS, THE PORTION TO BE PAID BY ASSESSMENTS, AND THE MANNER AND TIMING IN WHICH THE ASSESSMENTS ARE TO BE PAID.  A.	The total estimated cost of the Project, including the portion that relates to the Boundary Amendment Parcel, is $185,929,000 (Estimated Cost), with the estimated cost of the portion of the Project related to the Boundary Amendment Parcel being $70,866,000 (Boundary Amendment Estimated Cost).  B.	The Assessments as they relate to the Boundary Amendment Parcel are anticipated to be levied and allocated in an amount to fund only a portion of the Boundary Amendment Estimated Cost.  Specifically, as set forth in more detail in Exhibit B, the Assessments to be levied and allocated to the Boundary Amendment Parcel will defray approximately $240,000,000, which is the anticipated maximum par value of any bonds and which includes a portion of the Boundary Amendment Estimated Cost, as well as other financing-related costs, as set forth in Exhibit B, and which is in addition to interest and collection costs.  On an annual basis, the Assessments to be levied and allocated to the Boundary Amendment Parcel will defray no more than approximately $92,300,000 per year, again as set forth in Exhibit B.  C.	The manner in which the Assessments shall be apportioned and paid is set forth in Exhibit B, as may be modified by supplemental assessment resolutions.  The Assessments will constitute a master lien, which may be imposed without further public hearing in one or more separate liens each securing a series of bonds, and each as determined by supplemental assessment resolution.  With respect to each lien securing a series of bonds, the special assessments shall be paid in not more than (30) thirty yearly installments.  The special assessments may be payable at the same time and in the same manner as are ad-valorem taxes and collected pursuant to Chapter 197, Florida Statutes; provided, however, that in the event the uniform non ad-valorem assessment method of collecting the Assessments is not available to the District in any year, or if determined by the District to be in its best interest, the Assessments may be collected as is otherwise permitted by law, including but not limited to by direct bill.  The decision to collect special assessments by any particular method  e.g., on the tax roll or by direct bill  does not mean that such method will be used to collect special assessments in future years, and the District reserves the right to select collection methods in any given year, regardless of past practices.	5.	DESIGNATING THE LANDS UPON WHICH THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS SHALL BE LEVIED.  The Assessments securing the Project shall be levied on the lands within the District, including the Boundary Amendment Parcel, as described in Exhibit B, and as further designated by the assessment plat hereinafter provided for.	6.	ASSESSMENT PLAT.  Pursuant to Section 170.04, Florida Statutes, there is on file, at the District Records Office, an assessment plat showing the area to be assessed with certain plans and specifications describing the Project and the estimated cost of the Project, all of which shall be open to inspection by the public.  	7.	PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT ROLL.  Pursuant to Section 170.06, Florida Statutes, the District Manager has caused to be made a preliminary assessment roll, in accordance with the method of assessment described in Exhibit B hereto, which shows the lots and lands assessed, the amount of benefit to and the assessment against each lot or parcel of land and the number of annual installments into which the assessment may be divided, which assessment roll is hereby adopted and approved as the Districts preliminary assessment roll.  	8.	DIRECTION TO PROVIDE NOTICE OF THE HEARINGS. The Board shall adopt a subsequent resolution to fix a time and place at which the owners of property to be assessed or any other persons interested therein may appear before the Board and be heard as to the propriety and advisability of the assessments or the making of the Improvements, the cost thereof, the manner of payment therefore, or the amount thereof to be assessed against each property as improved.  	9.	PUBLICATION OF RESOLUTION.  Pursuant to Section 170.05, Florida Statutes, the District Manager is hereby directed to cause this Resolution to be published twice (once a week for two (2) weeks) in a newspaper of general circulation within the County and to provide such other notice as may be required by law or desired in the best interests of the District.  10.	CONFLICTS.  All resolutions or parts thereof in conflict herewith are, to the extent of such conflict, superseded and repealed.  As a point of clarification, Resolution 2023-12 remains in full force and effect, and the intent of this Resolution is solely to add the Boundary Amendment Parcel to the property subject to the Assessments originally levied pursuant to Resolution 2023-12.11.	SEVERABILITY.  If any section or part of a section of this resolution be declared invalid or unconstitutional, the validity, force, and effect of any other section or part of a section of this resolution shall not thereby be affected or impaired unless it clearly appears that such other section or part of a section of this resolution is wholly or necessarily dependent upon the section or part of a section so held to be invalid or unconstitutional.  	12.

Public  hearings will be held in the County Commissioners Chambers located on the first floor  of the Orange County Administration Building, 201 S. Rosalind Avenue beginning at  9:00 a.m. or as soon thereafter as possible.  Please be advised that Section 286.0105, Florida Statutes, states that if a person  decides to appeal any decision made by a board, agency, or commission with respect to  any matter considered at a meeting or hearing he will need a record of the proceedings,  and that for such purpose, he may need to ensure a verbatim record of the proceedings  is made, which record includes the testimony and evidence upon which the appeal is to  be based.  The notated public hearing is quasi-judicial in nature. As such, any verbal or written  communication with a member of the Board of Zoning Adjustment prior to todays quasi judicial hearing should be disclosed on the record or made a part of the record during  the public hearing by or on behalf of the party who communicated with the Board  member to allow any interested party an opportunity to inquire about or respond to such  communication. Failure to disclose any such communication may place the party who  ultimately prevails at the quasi-judicial hearing at risk of having the Boards decision  overturned in a court of law due to prejudice against the party who was not privy to the  ex parte communication.
