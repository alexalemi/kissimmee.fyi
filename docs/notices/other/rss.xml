Notice is hereby provided that the South Florida Water Management District, on November 21, 2025 issued an Environmental Resource Permit #49-112324-P, Application #250912-56991 to Forestar (USA) Real Estate Group, Inc., 1064 Greenwood Blvd, Suite 200, Lake Mary, FL 32746, authorizing construction and operation of stormwater management system serving 17.88 acres for a 43 lot single-family residential subdivision development known as Travis Landing Construction Plans in Osceola County, located at Section 12, Township 26, Range 28. A copy of the permit can be obtained by contacting the Regulatory Records Management Section, during normal business hours, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays, at 3301 Gun Club Road, West Palm Beach, FL 33406, Regulation Division, by telephone at 561-682-6911, by e-mail at permits@sfwmd.gov, or by accessing the permit directly from the Districts website (www.sfwmd.gov) using the Application/Permit Search on the ePermitting page. The District's agency action is final unless a timely petition for an administrative hearing is filed under Sections 120.569 and 120.57 of the Florida Statutes before the deadline for filing a petition. As required by Sections 120.569 and 120.60(3), Fla. Stat., the following is notice of the opportunities which may be available for administrative hearing or judicial review when the substantial interests of a party are determined by an agency. Please note that this Notice of Rights is not intended to provide legal advice. Not all of the legal proceedings detailed below may be an applicable or appropriate remedy. You may wish to consult an attorney regarding your legal rights.
RIGHT TO REQUEST ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING
A person whose substantial interests are or may be affected by the South Florida Water Management Districts (SFWMD or District) action has the right to request an administrative hearing on that action pursuant to Sections 120.569 and 120.57, Fla. Stat. Persons seeking a hearing on a SFWMD decision which affects or may affect their substantial interests shall file a petition for hearing with the Office of the District Clerk of the SFWMD, in accordance with the filing instructions set forth herein, within 21 days of receipt of written notice of the decision, unless one of the following shorter time periods apply: (1) within 14 days of the notice of consolidated intent to grant or deny concurrently reviewed applications for environmental resource permits and use of sovereign submerged lands pursuant to Section 373.427, Fla. Stat.; or (2) within 14 days of service of an Administrative Order pursuant to Section 373.119(1), Fla. Stat. "Receipt of written notice of agency decision" means receipt of written notice through mail, electronic mail, or posting that the SFWMD has or intends to take final agency action, or publication of notice that the SFWMD has or intends to take final agency action. Any person who receives written notice of a SFWMD decision and fails to file a written request for hearing within the timeframe described above waives the right to request a hearing on that decision.
If the District takes final agency action which materially differs from the noticed intended agency decision, persons who may be substantially affected shall, unless otherwise provided by law, have an additional Rule 28-106.111, Fla. Admin. Code, point of entry.
Any person to whom an emergency order is directed pursuant to Section 373.119(2), Fla. Stat., shall comply therewith immediately, but on petition to the board shall be afforded a hearing as soon as possible.
A person may file a request for an extension of time for filing a petition. The SFWMD may, for good cause, grant the request. Requests for extension of time must be filed with the SFWMD prior to the deadline for filing a petition for hearing. Such requests for extension shall contain a certificate that the moving party has consulted with all other parties concerning the extension and that the SFWMD and any other parties agree to or oppose the extension. A timely request for an extension of time shall toll the running of the time period for filing a petition until the request is acted upon.
FILING INSTRUCTIONS
A petition for administrative hearing must be filed with the Office of the District Clerk of the SFWMD. Filings with the Office of the District Clerk may be made by mail, hand-delivery, or e-mail. Filings by facsimile will not be accepted. A petition for administrative hearing or other document is deemed filed upon receipt during normal business hours by the Office of the District Clerk at SFWMD headquarters in West Palm Beach, Florida. The Districts normal business hours are 8:00 a.m.  5:00 p.m., excluding weekends and District holidays. Any document received by the Office of the District Clerk after 5:00 p.m. shall be deemed filed as of 8:00 a.m. on the next regular business day. Additional filing instructions are as follows:
 * Filings by mail must be addressed to the Office of the District Clerk, 3301 Gun Club Road, West Palm Beach, Florida 33406.
 * Filings by hand-delivery must be delivered to the Office of the District Clerk. Delivery of a petition to the SFWMD's security desk does not constitute filing.

 * Filings by e-mail must be transmitted to the Office of the District Clerk at clerk@sfwmd.gov. The filing date for a document transmitted by electronic mail shall be the date the Office of the District Clerk receives the complete document. A party who files a document by e-mail shall (1) represent that the original physically signed document will be retained by that party for the duration of the proceeding and of any subsequent appeal or subsequent proceeding in that cause and that the party shall produce it upon the request of other parties; and (2) be responsible for any delay, disruption, or interruption of the electronic signals and accepts the full risk that the document may not be properly filed.
INITIATION OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING
Pursuant to Sections 120.54(5)(b)4. and 120.569(2)(c), Fla. Stat., and Rules 28-106.201 and 28-106.301, Fla. Admin. Code, initiation of an administrative hearing shall be made by written petition to the SFWMD in legible form and on 8  by 11 inch white paper. All petitions shall contain:

The boiler will be used to generate steam if the steam electric generator units are offline, or in the case of an outage at the facility. The boiler will be equipped with low NOx burners to reduce NOx emissions. Emissions from this project were estimated to be 15.15 tons per year (TPY) of carbon monoxide, 9.02 TPY of NOx, 1.37 TPY of particulate matter, and all other pollutants were are less than 1.0 TPY. Emission increases from the project are below the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) significant emission rate thresholds.

Permitting Authority: Applications for air construction permits are subject to review in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 403, Florida Statutes (F.S.) and Chapters 62-4, 62-210 and 62-212, F.A.C. The proposed project is not exempt from air permitting requirements and an air permit is required to perform the proposed work. The Permitting Authority responsible for making a permit determination for this project is the Permit Review Section in the Department of Environmental Protections Division of Air Resource Management. The Permitting Authoritys physical address is: 2600 Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee, Florida. The Permitting Authoritys mailing address is: 2600 Blair Stone Road, MS #5505, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-2400. The Permitting Authoritys phone number is 850-717-9000.  Project File: A complete project file is available for public inspection during the normal business hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday (except legal holidays), at the address indicated above for the Permitting Authority.

Notice of Intent to Issue Air Permit: The Permitting Authority gives notice of its intent to issue an air construction permit to the applicant for the project described above. The applicant has provided reasonable assurance that operation of proposed equipment will not adversely impact air quality and that the project will comply with all applicable provisions of Chapters 62-4, 62-204, 62-210, 62-212, 62-296 and 62-297, F.A.C. The Permitting Authority will issue a Final Permit in accordance with the conditions of the proposed Draft Permit unless a timely petition for an administrative hearing is filed under Sections 120.569 and 120.57, F.S. or unless public comment received in accordance with this notice results in a different decision or a significant change of terms or conditions.  Comments: The Permitting Authority will accept written comments concerning the proposed Draft Permit for a period of 14 days from the date of publication of the Public Notice. Written comments must be received by the Permitting Authority by close of business (5:00 p.m.) on or before the end of this 14-day period to the above address and electronically to David Read at David.Read@FloridaDEP.gov. If written comments received result in a significant change to the Draft Permit, the Permitting Authority shall revise the Draft Permit and require, if applicable, another Public Notice. All comments filed will be made available for public inspection.  Petitions: A person whose substantial interests are affected by the proposed permitting decision may petition for an administrative hearing in accordance with Sections 120.569 and 120.57, F.S. Petitions filed by any persons other than those entitled to written notice under Section 120.60(3), F.S., must be filed within 14 days of publication of the Public Notice or receipt of a written notice, whichever occurs first. Under Section 120.60(3), F.S., however, any person who asked the Permitting Authority for notice of agency action may file a petition within 14 days of receipt of that notice, regardless of the date of publication. A petitioner shall mail a copy of the petition to the applicant at the address indicated above, at the time of filing. A petition for administrative hearing must contain the information set forth below and must be filed (received) with the Agency Clerk in the Office of General Counsel, 3900 Commonwealth Boulevard, MS 35, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-3000, Agency_Clerk@dep.state.fl.us, before the deadline. The failure of any person to file a petition within the appropriate time period shall constitute a waiver of that persons right to request an administrative determination (hearing) under Sections 120.569 and 120.57, F.S., or to intervene in this proceeding and participate as a party to it. Any subsequent intervention (in a proceeding initiated by another party) will be only at the approval of the presiding officer upon the filing of a motion in compliance with Rule 28-106.205, F.A.C.  A petition that disputes the material facts on which the Permitting Authoritys action is based must contain the following information: (a) The name and address of each agency affected and each agencys file or identification number, if known; (b) The name, address, any email address, telephone number and any facsimile number of the petitioner; the name, address any email address, telephone number, and any facsimile number of the petitioners representative, if any, which shall be the address for service purposes during the course of the proceeding; and an explanation of how the petitioners substantial interests will be affected by the agency determination; (c) A statement of when and how each petitioner received notice of the agency action or proposed decision; (d) A statement of all disputed issues of material fact. If there are none, the petition must so state; (e) A concise statement of the ultimate facts alleged, including the specific facts the petitioner contends warrant reversal or modification of the agencys proposed action; (f) A statement of the specific rules or statutes the petitioner contends require reversal or modification of the agencys proposed action including an explanation of how the alleged facts relate to the specific rules or statutes; and, (g) A statement of the relief sought by the petitioner, stating precisely the action the petitioner wishes the agency to take with respect to the agencys proposed action. A petition that does not dispute the material facts upon which the Permitting Authoritys action is based shall state that no such facts are in dispute and otherwise shall contain the same information as set forth above, as required by Rule 28-106.301, F.A.C.  Because the administrative hearing process is designed to formulate final agency action, the filing of a petition means that the Permitting Authoritys final action may be different from the position taken by it in this Public Notice of Intent to Issue Air Permit. Persons whose substantial interests will be affected by any such final decision of the Permitting Authority on the application have the right to petition to become a party to the proceeding, in accordance with the requirements set forth above.  Extension of Time: Under Rule 62-110.106(4), F.A.C., a person whose substantial interests are affected by the Departments action may also request an extension of time to file a petition for an administrative hearing. The Department may, for good cause shown, grant the request for an extension of time. Requests for extension of time must be filed with the Office of General Counsel of the Department at 3900 Commonwealth Boulevard, Mail Station 35, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-3000, or via electronic correspondence at Agency_Clerk@dep.state.fl.us, before the deadline for filing a petition for an administrative hearing. A timely request for extension of time shall toll the running of the time period for filing a petition until the request is acted upon.  Mediation: Mediation is not available in this proceeding. 7903987 12/05/2025</description>

--- Full Notice Text ---
11/30/2025 PUBLIC NOTICE  SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMENT TO 2025-2026 ANNUAL ACTION PLAN  Notice is hereby given that, in accordance with 24 CFR 91.105(c)(2) of the federal regulations related to citizen participation in Community Planning and Development Programs, Orange County is making a substantial amendment to the 2025-2026 Annual Action Plan available to the public through this notice. This amendment is available for a 30-day public review and comment period from December 1, 2025, to December 30, 2025. Orange County receives federal funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) Program, and Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG). As a recipient of federal funds, the County is required to develop an Annual Action Plan that identifies specific activities that Orange County intends to pursue through the CDBG, HOME, ESG, and other state and local housing and community development programs, to address the objectives identified in the 2022-2026 Orange County Consolidated Plan. The FY 2025-2026 Annual Action Plan covers the period starting October 1, 2025, through September 30, 2026, and it was approved by the Board of County Commissioners on August 5, 2025. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) was created by the Housing Economic Recovery Act of 2008 to respond to the rising residential foreclosures and property abandonment, and to stabilize communities negatively impacted by foreclosures. Orange County received two allocations of NSP funds (NSP-1 and NSP-3) that were used for the following activities: 1) acquire, rehabilitate, and re-sell foreclosed homes to income- qualified buyers; 2) provide financial incentives to homebuyers of foreclosed homes; 3) acquire and rehabilitate foreclosed multifamily housing. The County is currently in the process of closing out both of the NSP programs, in accordance with HUD requirements and guidance. The Orange County Citizen Participation Plan, which was last updated in November of 2023, requires a substantial amendment to an approved Annual Action Plan when there is a change that adds a new activity. In accordance with requirements of the Citizen Participation Plan and 24 CFR Part 91.505, the County is proposing a substantial amendment to its FY 2025-2026 Annual Action Plan to transfer the program income from the NSP-3 Program, in the amount of $589,930.22, to the CDBG Program. The re-allocated funds will be expended on the CDBG-eligible activities to address the needs, priorities and goals identified in the 2022-2026 Orange County Consolidated Plan. The public will have the opportunity to review and comment on the proposed amendment to the 2025-2026 Annual Action Plan beginning Monday, December 1, 2025, through Tuesday, December 30, 2025. The draft amendment document will be available for review at Orange Countys website at the following link: http://www.ocfl.net/NeighborsHousing/CommunityDevelopment.aspx. All comments regarding these documents should be submitted during the public comment period identified above to: Janna Souvorova, Ph.D., AICP, Chief Planner Housing and Community Development Division 525 E. South Street, Orlando, FL 32801 Phone: (407) 836-0963 E-mail: Janna.Souvorova@ocfl.net  Section 286.0105, Florida Statutes, states that if a person decides to appeal any decision made by a board, agency, or commission with respect to any matter considered at a meeting or hearing, he or she will need a record of the proceedings, and that, for such purpose, he or she may need to ensure that a verbatim record of the proceedings is made, which record includes the testimony and evidence upon which the appeal is to be based.

ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT, SOUTH FLORIDA WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND SOUTHWEST FLORIDA WATER MANAGEMENT  DISTRICT GIVE NOTICE OF DISTRICT DECISION   The St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD), South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD), and Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) (collectively, the Districts) give notice of their decision approving the 2025 Central Florida Water Initiative Regional Water Supply Plan (CFWI RWSP), which was jointly developed by the Districts in coordination with stakeholders. The documents are further described below:  1. 2025 CFWI RWSP is available at https://aws.sjrwmd.com/CFWI/pdfs/CFWI-2025-RWSP-Draft-Final-Plan-Doc-10-3- 25.pdf 2. Appendices to 2025 CFWI RWSP is available at https://aws.sjrwmd.com/CFWI/pdfs/CFWI-2025-RWSP-Draft-Final-Appendices-10-3- 25.pdf  The 2025 CFWI RWSP was developed and approved to implement Section 373.709, Florida Statutes (F.S.). In the 2025 CFWI RWSP, the Districts have determined that existing sources of water are not adequate in all of Orange, Osceola, Polk, and Seminole Counties, and southern Lake County (CFWI Planning Area) to supply water for all existing and future reasonable- beneficial uses and to sustain the water resources and related natural systems through 2045. The CFWI Planning Area shall be considered a Water Resource Caution Area (WRCA) for the purposes of Section 403.064, F.S. The 2020 CFWI RWSP identifies alternative water supply (AWS) projects from which water suppliers may choose for meeting water supply needs within the designated WRCA. Although AWS projects added to the 2025 CFWI RWSP are potentially eligible for certain District funding, there is no assurance of funding.  The file(s) containing the 2025 CFWI RWSP are available for inspection Monday through Friday, except for legal holidays, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., at the following locations: St. Johns River Water Management District Headquarters, 4049 Reid St., Palatka, Florida, 32177-2529; South Florida Water Management District Headquarters, 3301 Gun Club Road, West Palm Beach, Florida 33406; Molly Brown, District Clerk, (561) 682-6805; and Southwest Florida Water Management District Headquarters, 2379 Broad Street, Brooksville, FL 34604. If you wish to receive a copy, please submit your request to the District Clerk, St. Johns River Water Management District; Office of the District Clerk of the South Florida Water Management District, Attention: Molly Brown, District Clerk; or General Services Bureau, Southwest Florida Water Management District, Attention: Peggy Meinhardt, Records Manager at the addresses listed above. You may also review these documents by using your web browser to go to https://cfwiwater.com.  A person whose substantial interests may be affected by the Districts decision on this regional water supply plan or the designation of the CFWI Planning Area as a water resource caution area has the right to request an administrative hearing in accordance with Section 120.569 and 120.57, F.S., and Chapter 28-106, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.).

Because the administrative hearing process is designed to formulate final agency action, the timely filing of a request for hearing may result in the Districts final action being different from its original action.

--- Full Notice Text ---
NOTICE OF INTENT TO ADOPT RULES OF THE SOUTH FLORIDA WATERMANAGEMENT DISTRICTThe South Florida Water Management District (District) is proposing to amend Rule 40E-1.607, F.A.C. as follows: 1) reduce the transfer fee for consumptive use permits (CUP) from $300 to $0; 2) add a CUP fee category for a 30-day backup supply for interrupted reclaimed water service, which will encourage the use of reclaimed water and reward those who currently use reclaimed water; and 3) add a CUP fee category to credit the processing fee for a CUP application that is withdrawn to a new application or notice received from the same applicant if done within 365 days from when the original application was withdrawn. The proposed amendments will reduce regulatory costs and will make the Districts CUP program consistent with its environmental resource permitting program.   On November 13, 2025, the Districts Governing Board authorized District staff to publish a Notice of Proposed Rule and adopt the proposed amendments to Rule 40E-1.607, F.A.C. Any affected person may request a public hearing on the rules within 21 days of the date the Notice of Proposed Rule is published in the Florida Administrative Register. If no request for a public hearing is timely received and no material changes are made to the proposed rules, the District will proceed with filing the proposed rules for adoption with the Department of State.   SUMMARY OF STATEMENT OF ESTIMATED REGULATORY COSTS AND LEGISLATIVE RATIFICATION:  The SFWMD has determined that the proposed rules will not have an adverse impact on small businesses and is not likely to increase, directly or indirectly, regulatory costs in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate within one year after the implementation of the rule. The District has not prepared a Statement of Estimated Regulatory Costs (SERC). The District has determined that the proposed rule is not expected to require legislative ratification.   A copy of the proposed Rule 40E-1.607, F.A.C., may be obtained on the Districts website at https://www.sfwmd.gov/doing-business-with-us/rules, and the Notice of Proposed Rule may be obtained on the Department of States website at http://www.flrules.org, where you may subscribe to receive copies of further notices for this or other rule chapters or types of notices of interest.

--- Full Notice Text ---
NOTICE OF INTENT TO ADOPT RULES OF
THE SOUTH FLORIDA WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT


The South Florida Water Management District (District) is proposing to amend Rule 40E-1.607, F.A.C. as follows: 1) reduce the transfer fee for consumptive use permits (CUP) from $300 to $0; 2) add a CUP fee category for a 30-day backup supply for interrupted reclaimed water service, which will encourage the use of reclaimed water and reward those who currently use reclaimed water; and 3) add a CUP fee category to credit the processing fee for a CUP application that is withdrawn to a new application or notice received from the same applicant if done within 365 days from when the original application was withdrawn. The proposed amendments will reduce regulatory costs and will make the Districts CUP program consistent with its environmental resource permitting program.


On November 13, 2025, the Districts Governing Board authorized District staff to publish a Notice of Proposed Rule and adopt the proposed amendments to Rule 40E-1.607, F.A.C. Any affected person may request a public hearing on the rules within 21 days of the date the Notice of Proposed Rule is published in the Florida Administrative Register. If no request for a public hearing is timely received and no material changes are made to the proposed rules, the District will proceed with filing the proposed rules for adoption with the Department of State.

SUMMARY OF STATEMENT OF ESTIMATED REGULATORY COSTS AND LEGISLATIVE RATIFICATION:
The SFWMD has determined that the proposed rules will not have an adverse impact on small businesses and is not likely to increase, directly or indirectly, regulatory costs in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate within one year after the implementation of the rule. The District has not prepared a Statement of Estimated Regulatory Costs (SERC). The District has determined that the proposed rule is not expected to require legislative ratification,

A copy of the proposed Rule 40E-1.607, F.A.C., may be obtained on the Districts website at https://www.sfwmd.gov/doing-business-with-us/rules, and the Notice of Proposed Rule may be obtained on the Department of States website at http://www.flrules.org, where you may subscribe to receive copies of further notices for this or other rule chapters or types of notices of interest. For more information, contact: Simon Sunderland, Bureau Chief, Water Use-Regulation, ssunderland@sfwmd.gov, or (561) 682-2705.
