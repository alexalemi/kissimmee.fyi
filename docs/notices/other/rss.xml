This Permit authorizes construction and operation of a stormwater management (SWM) system and associated SWM infrastructure to serve 28.21 acres and 154 residential lots in Stonebridge Park. The SWM system consists of inlets and storm sewer to collect and convey runoff to a wet detention system with outfall through a control structure to the ditch along Batton Road before discharging through existing cross drains under Jones Road.  A copy of the permit can be obtained by contacting the SFWMD Regulatory Records Management Section, during normal business hours, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays, at 3301 Gun Club Road, West Palm Beach, FL 33406, Regulation Division, by telephone at 561-682-6911, by e-mail at permits@sfwmd.gov, or by accessing the permit directly from the Districts website (www.sfwmd.gov) using the Application/Permit Search on the RegPermitting page.  The Districts agency action is final unless a timely petition for an administrative hearing is filed under Sections 120.569 and 120.57 of the Florida Statutes before the deadline for filing a petition.  As required by Sections 120.569 and 120.60(3), Fla. Stat., the following is notice of the opportunities which may be available for administrative hearing or judicial review when the substantial interests of a party are determined by an agency. Please note that this Notice of Rights is not intended to provide legal advice. Not all of the legal proceedings detailed below may be an applicable or appropriate remedy. You may wish to consult an attorney regarding your legal rights.  RIGHT TO REQUEST ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING A person whose substantial interests are or may be affected by the South Florida Water Management Districts (SFWMD or District) action has the right to request an administrative hearing on that action pursuant to Sections 120.569 and 120.57, Fla. Stat. Persons seeking a hearing on a SFWMD decision which affects or may affect their substantial interests shall file a petition for hearing with the Office of the District Clerk of the SFWMD, in accordance with the filing instructions set forth herein, within 21 days of receipt of written notice of the decision, unless one of the following shorter time periods apply: (1) within 14 days of the notice of consolidated intent to grant or deny concurrently reviewed applications for environmental resource permits and use of sovereign submerged lands pursuant to Section 373.427, Fla. Stat.; or (2) within 14 days of service of an Administrative Order pursuant to Section 373.119(1), Fla. Stat.

Such requests for extension shall contain a certificate that the moving party has consulted with all other parties concerning the extension and that the SFWMD and any other parties agree to or oppose the extension. A timely request for an extension of time shall toll the running of the time period for filing a petition until the request is acted upon.

Notice is hereby provided that the South Florida Water Management District, on December 30, 2025, issued an Environmental Resource Permit #49-114582-P, Application #250821-56211 to Forestar (USA) Real Estate Group, Inc., authorizing construction and operation of stormwater management system serving the residential development known as Thomason Estates, Osceola County, located at Section 13, Township 26, Range 30. The project will develop 30 single family lots and associated stormwater infrastructure serving 10.31 acres of residential development. A copy of the permit can be obtained by contacting the Regulatory Records Management Section, during normal business hours, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays, at 3301 Gun Club Road, West Palm Beach, FL 33406, Regulation Division, by telephone at 561-682-6911, by e-mail at permits@sfwmd.gov, or by accessing the permit directly from the Districts website (www.sfwmd.gov) using the Application/Permit Search on the ePermitting page.
The District's agency action is final unless a timely petition for an administrative hearing is filed under Sections 120.569 and 120.57 of the Florida Statutes before the deadline for filing a petition.
As required by Sections 120.569 and 120.60(3), Fla. Stat., the following is notice of the opportunities which may be available for administrative hearing or judicial review when the substantial interests of a party are determined by an agency. Please note that this Notice of Rights is not intended to provide legal advice. Not all of the legal proceedings detailed below may be an applicable or appropriate remedy. You may wish to consult an attorney regarding your legal rights.
RIGHT TO REQUEST ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING
A person whose substantial interests are or may be affected by the South Florida Water Management Districts (SFWMD or District) action has the right to request an administrative hearing on that action pursuant to Sections 120.569 and 120.57, Fla. Stat. Persons seeking a hearing on a SFWMD decision which affects or may affect their substantial interests shall file a petition for hearing with the Office of the District Clerk of the SFWMD, in accordance with the filing instructions set forth herein, within 21 days of receipt of written notice of the decision, unless one of the following shorter time periods apply: (1) within 14 days of the notice of consolidated intent to grant or deny concurrently reviewed applications for environmental resource permits and use of sovereign submerged lands pursuant to Section 373.427, Fla. Stat.; or (2) within 14 days of service of an Administrative Order pursuant to Section 373.119(1), Fla. Stat. "Receipt of written notice of agency decision" means receipt of written notice through mail, electronic mail, or posting that the SFWMD has or intends to take final agency action, or publication of notice that the SFWMD has or intends to take final agency action. Any person who receives written notice of a SFWMD decision and fails to file a written request for hearing within the timeframe described above waives the right to request a hearing on that decision.
If the District takes final agency action which materially differs from the noticed intended agency decision, persons who may be substantially affected shall, unless otherwise provided by law, have an additional Rule 28-106.111, Fla. Admin. Code, point of entry.
Any person to whom an emergency order is directed pursuant to Section 373.119(2), Fla. Stat., shall comply therewith immediately, but on petition to the board shall be afforded a hearing as soon as possible.
A person may file a request for an extension of time for filing a petition. The SFWMD may, for good cause, grant the request. Requests for extension of time must be filed with the SFWMD prior to the deadline for filing a petition for hearing. Such requests for extension shall contain a certificate that the moving party has consulted with all other parties concerning the extension and that the SFWMD and any other parties agree to or oppose the extension. A timely request for an extension of time shall toll the running of the time period for filing a petition until the request is acted upon.
FILING INSTRUCTIONS
A petition for administrative hearing must be filed with the Office of the District Clerk of the SFWMD. Filings with the Office of the District Clerk may be made by mail, hand-delivery, or e-mail. Filings by facsimile will not be accepted.

The Districts normal business hours are 8:00 a.m.  5:00 p.m., excluding weekends and District holidays.

 * Filings by e-mail must be transmitted to the Office of the District Clerk at clerk@sfwmd.gov. The filing date for a document transmitted by electronic mail shall be the date the Office of the District Clerk receives the complete document. A party who files a document by e-mail shall (1) represent that the original physically signed document will be retained by that party for the duration of the proceeding and of any subsequent appeal or subsequent proceeding in that cause and that the party shall produce it upon the request of other parties; and (2) be responsible for any delay, disruption, or interruption of the electronic signals and accepts the full risk that the document may not be properly filed.
INITIATION OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING
Pursuant to Sections 120.54(5)(b)4. and 120.569(2)(c), Fla. Stat., and Rules 28-106.201 and 28-106.301, Fla. Admin. Code, initiation of an administrative hearing shall be made by written petition to the SFWMD in legible form and on 8  by 11 inch white paper. All petitions shall contain:
