The District's agency action is final unless a timely petition for an administrative hearing is filed under Sections 120.569 and 120.57 of the Florida Statutes before the deadline for filing a petition. As required by Sections 120.569 and 120.60(3), Fla. Stat., the following is notice of the opportunities which may be available for administrative hearing or judicial review when the substantial interests of a party are determined by an agency. Please note that this Notice of Rights is not intended to provide legal advice. Not all of the legal proceedings detailed below may be an applicable or appropriate remedy. You may wish to consult an attorney regarding your legal rights.
RIGHT TO REQUEST ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING
A person whose substantial interests are or may be affected by the South Florida Water Management Districts (SFWMD or District) action has the right to request an administrative hearing on that action pursuant to Sections 120.569 and 120.57, Fla. Stat. Persons seeking a hearing on a SFWMD decision which affects or may affect their substantial interests shall file a petition for hearing with the Office of the District Clerk of the SFWMD, in accordance with the filing instructions set forth herein, within 21 days of receipt of written notice of the decision, unless one of the following shorter time periods apply: (1) within 14 days of the notice of consolidated intent to grant or deny concurrently reviewed applications for environmental resource permits and use of sovereign submerged lands pursuant to Section 373.427, Fla. Stat.; or (2) within 14 days of service of an Administrative Order pursuant to Section 373.119(1), Fla. Stat. "Receipt of written notice of agency decision" means receipt of written notice through mail, electronic mail, or posting that the SFWMD has or intends to take final agency action, or publication of notice that the SFWMD has or intends to take final agency action. Any person who receives written notice of a SFWMD decision and fails to file a written request for hearing within the timeframe described above waives the right to request a hearing on that decision.
If the District takes final agency action which materially differs from the noticed intended agency decision, persons who may be substantially affected shall, unless otherwise provided by law, have an additional Rule 28-106.111, Fla. Admin. Code, point of entry.
Any person to whom an emergency order is directed pursuant to Section 373.119(2), Fla. Stat., shall comply therewith immediately, but on petition to the board shall be afforded a hearing as soon as possible.
A person may file a request for an extension of time for filing a petition. The SFWMD may, for good cause, grant the request. Requests for extension of time must be filed with the SFWMD prior to the deadline for filing a petition for hearing. Such requests for extension shall contain a certificate that the moving party has consulted with all other parties concerning the extension and that the SFWMD and any other parties agree to or oppose the extension. A timely request for an extension of time shall toll the running of the time period for filing a petition until the request is acted upon.
FILING INSTRUCTIONS
A petition for administrative hearing must be filed with the Office of the District Clerk of the SFWMD. Filings with the Office of the District Clerk may be made by mail, hand-delivery, or e-mail. Filings by facsimile will not be accepted. A petition for administrative hearing or other document is deemed filed upon receipt during normal business hours by the Office of the District Clerk at SFWMD headquarters in West Palm Beach, Florida. The Districts normal business hours are 8:00 a.m.  5:00 p.m., excluding weekends and District holidays. Any document received by the Office of the District Clerk after 5:00 p.m. shall be deemed filed as of 8:00 a.m. on the next regular business day. Additional filing instructions are as follows:
 * Filings by mail must be addressed to the Office of the District Clerk, 3301 Gun Club Road, West Palm Beach, Florida 33406.
 * Filings by hand-delivery must be delivered to the Office of the District Clerk. Delivery of a petition to the SFWMD's security desk does not constitute filing.

 * Filings by e-mail must be transmitted to the Office of the District Clerk at clerk@sfwmd.gov. The filing date for a document transmitted by electronic mail shall be the date the Office of the District Clerk receives the complete document. A party who files a document by e-mail shall (1) represent that the original physically signed document will be retained by that party for the duration of the proceeding and of any subsequent appeal or subsequent proceeding in that cause and that the party shall produce it upon the request of other parties; and (2) be responsible for any delay, disruption, or interruption of the electronic signals and accepts the full risk that the document may not be properly filed.
INITIATION OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING
Pursuant to Sections 120.54(5)(b)4. and 120.569(2)(c), Fla. Stat., and Rules 28-106.201 and 28-106.301, Fla. Admin. Code, initiation of an administrative hearing shall be made by written petition to the SFWMD in legible form and on 8  by 11 inch white paper. All petitions shall contain:

--- Full Notice Text ---
11/30/2025 PUBLIC NOTICE  SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMENT TO 2025-2026 ANNUAL ACTION PLAN  Notice is hereby given that, in accordance with 24 CFR 91.105(c)(2) of the federal regulations related to citizen participation in Community Planning and Development Programs, Orange County is making a substantial amendment to the 2025-2026 Annual Action Plan available to the public through this notice. This amendment is available for a 30-day public review and comment period from December 1, 2025, to December 30, 2025. Orange County receives federal funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) Program, and Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG). As a recipient of federal funds, the County is required to develop an Annual Action Plan that identifies specific activities that Orange County intends to pursue through the CDBG, HOME, ESG, and other state and local housing and community development programs, to address the objectives identified in the 2022-2026 Orange County Consolidated Plan. The FY 2025-2026 Annual Action Plan covers the period starting October 1, 2025, through September 30, 2026, and it was approved by the Board of County Commissioners on August 5, 2025. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) was created by the Housing Economic Recovery Act of 2008 to respond to the rising residential foreclosures and property abandonment, and to stabilize communities negatively impacted by foreclosures. Orange County received two allocations of NSP funds (NSP-1 and NSP-3) that were used for the following activities: 1) acquire, rehabilitate, and re-sell foreclosed homes to income- qualified buyers; 2) provide financial incentives to homebuyers of foreclosed homes; 3) acquire and rehabilitate foreclosed multifamily housing. The County is currently in the process of closing out both of the NSP programs, in accordance with HUD requirements and guidance. The Orange County Citizen Participation Plan, which was last updated in November of 2023, requires a substantial amendment to an approved Annual Action Plan when there is a change that adds a new activity. In accordance with requirements of the Citizen Participation Plan and 24 CFR Part 91.505, the County is proposing a substantial amendment to its FY 2025-2026 Annual Action Plan to transfer the program income from the NSP-3 Program, in the amount of $589,930.22, to the CDBG Program. The re-allocated funds will be expended on the CDBG-eligible activities to address the needs, priorities and goals identified in the 2022-2026 Orange County Consolidated Plan. The public will have the opportunity to review and comment on the proposed amendment to the 2025-2026 Annual Action Plan beginning Monday, December 1, 2025, through Tuesday, December 30, 2025. The draft amendment document will be available for review at Orange Countys website at the following link: http://www.ocfl.net/NeighborsHousing/CommunityDevelopment.aspx. All comments regarding these documents should be submitted during the public comment period identified above to: Janna Souvorova, Ph.D., AICP, Chief Planner Housing and Community Development Division 525 E. South Street, Orlando, FL 32801 Phone: (407) 836-0963 E-mail: Janna.Souvorova@ocfl.net  Section 286.0105, Florida Statutes, states that if a person decides to appeal any decision made by a board, agency, or commission with respect to any matter considered at a meeting or hearing, he or she will need a record of the proceedings, and that, for such purpose, he or she may need to ensure that a verbatim record of the proceedings is made, which record includes the testimony and evidence upon which the appeal is to be based.
