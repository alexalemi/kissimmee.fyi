COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
NOTICE OF THE DISTRICTS INTENT TO USE THE 
UNIFORM METHOD OF COLLECTION OF NON-AD
VALOREM SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS


Notice is hereby given that the Visions at Orlando West Community Development District (the District) intends to use the uniform method of collecting non-ad valorem special assessments to be levied by the District pursuant to Section 197.3632, Florida Statutes. The Board of Supervisors of the District will conduct a public hearing on November 20, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. 4797 W. Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway, Suite F, Kissimmee, Florida 34746.


The purpose of the public hearing is to consider the adoption of a resolution authorizing the District to use the uniform method of collecting non-ad valorem special assessments (the Uniform Method) to be levied by the District on properties located on land included in within phases 5, 6 and 7 of the development plan of the District.


The District may levy non-ad valorem special assessments for the purpose of financing, acquiring, maintaining and/or operating community development facilities, services, and improvements within and without the boundaries of the District, to consist of, among other things, roadway improvements, utility improvements, stormwater management facilities, landscape and irrigation improvement, and/or any other lawful improvements or services of the District.


Owners of the properties to be assessed and other interested parties may appear at the public hearing and be heard regarding the use of the Uniform Method. This hearing is open to the public and will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Florida law. The public hearing may be continued to a date, time, and location to be specified on the record at the hearing. There may be occasions when Supervisors or District Staff may participate by speaker telephone.


Pursuant to provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, any person requiring special accommodations to participate in the hearing and/or meeting is asked to contact the District Managers office at 2300 Glades Road, Suite 410W, Boca Raton, Florida 33431, 561-571-0010, at least forty-eight (48) hours before the hearing and/or meeting.

The District&#x27;s agency action is final unless a timely petition for an administrative hearing is filed under Sections 120.569 and 120.57 of the Florida Statutes before the deadline for filing a petition.
As required by Sections 120.569 and 120.60(3), Fla. Stat., the following is notice of the opportunities which may be available for administrative hearing or judicial review when the substantial interests of a party are determined by an agency. Please note that this Notice of Rights is not intended to provide legal advice. Not all of the legal proceedings detailed below may be an applicable or appropriate remedy. You may wish to consult an attorney regarding your legal rights.
RIGHT TO REQUEST ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING
A person whose substantial interests are or may be affected by the South Florida Water Management Districts (SFWMD or District) action has the right to request an administrative hearing on that action pursuant to Sections 120.569 and 120.57, Fla. Stat. Persons seeking a hearing on a SFWMD decision which affects or may affect their substantial interests shall file a petition for hearing with the Office of the District Clerk of the SFWMD, in accordance with the filing instructions set forth herein, within 21 days of receipt of written notice of the decision, unless one of the following shorter time periods apply: (1) within 14 days of the notice of consolidated intent to grant or deny concurrently reviewed applications for environmental resource permits and use of sovereign submerged lands pursuant to Section 373.427, Fla. Stat.; or (2) within 14 days of service of an Administrative Order pursuant to Section 373.119(1), Fla. Stat. &quot;Receipt of written notice of agency decision&quot; means receipt of written notice through mail, electronic mail, or posting that the SFWMD has or intends to take final agency action, or publication of notice that the SFWMD has or intends to take final agency action. Any person who receives written notice of a SFWMD decision and fails to file a written request for hearing within the timeframe described above waives the right to request a hearing on that decision.
If the District takes final agency action which materially differs from the noticed intended agency decision, persons who may be substantially affected shall, unless otherwise provided by law, have an additional Rule 28-106.111, Fla. Admin. Code, point of entry.
Any person to whom an emergency order is directed pursuant to Section 373.119(2), Fla. Stat., shall comply therewith immediately, but on petition to the board shall be afforded a hearing as soon as possible.
A person may file a request for an extension of time for filing a petition. The SFWMD may, for good cause, grant the request. Requests for extension of time must be filed with the SFWMD prior to the deadline for filing a petition for hearing. Such requests for extension shall contain a certificate that the moving party has consulted with all other parties concerning the extension and that the SFWMD and any other parties agree to or oppose the extension. A timely request for an extension of time shall toll the running of the time period for filing a petition until the request is acted upon.
FILING INSTRUCTIONS
A petition for administrative hearing must be filed with the Office of the District Clerk of the SFWMD. Filings with the Office of the District Clerk may be made by mail, hand-delivery, or e-mail. Filings by facsimile will not be accepted.

An employee of the SFWMD&#x27;s Clerk&#x27;s office will receive and file the petition.
 * Filings by e-mail must be transmitted to the Office of the District Clerk at clerk@sfwmd.gov. The filing date for a document transmitted by electronic mail shall be the date the Office of the District Clerk receives the complete document. A party who files a document by e-mail shall (1) represent that the original physically signed document will be retained by that party for the duration of the proceeding and of any subsequent appeal or subsequent proceeding in that cause and that the party shall produce it upon the request of other parties; and (2) be responsible for any delay, disruption, or interruption of the electronic signals and accepts the full risk that the document may not be properly filed.

The Central Florida Expressway Authority (CFX) is holding a public meeting for design of Phase 1 for State Road 534. Phase 1 is a 5-mile section from SR 417 near Boggy Creek Road to Narcoossee Road and it is part of the SR 534 expressway. The entire SR 534 project is a 14-mile regional transportation network that will support the current and projected transportation needs in Southeast Orange and Northeast Osceola counties.


Once the 14-mile expressway is complete, it would help relieve congestion on local roadways, support evacuation and emergency response, and enhance regional connectivity with an expressway. SR 534 will be built in three separate phases. The design of Phase 1 is expected to be completed by early 2026, with construction anticipated to start in mid-2027. CFX will hold additional public meetings at a later date for Phase 2 and Phase 3. For full project information, visit: SR534.com .

<div class="full-text-content">PUBLIC NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE AIR PERMIT   Florida Department of Environmental Protection Division of Air Resource Management, Permit Review Section Draft Permit No. 0690046-030-AV, Title V Air Operation Permit Renewal Reworld Lake II, Inc., Lake County Resource Recovery Facility Lake County, Florida  Applicant: The applicant for this project is Reworld Lake II, Inc. The applicants responsible official and mailing address are: Mr. Gary Main, Facility Manager, Reworld Lake II, Inc., Lake County Resource Recovery Facility, 3830 Rogers Industrial Park Road, Okahumpka, Florida 34762.  Facility Location: Reworld Lake II, Inc. operates the Lake County Resource Recovery Facility, which is in Lake County at 3830 Rogers Industrial Park Road in Okahumpka, Florida.  Project: The purpose of this project is to issue a Title V air operation permit renewal for the facility. The project renews Title V air operation permit No. 0690046-023-AV. Details of the project are provided in the application and the Statement of Basis.  This facility consists of two identical mass-burn municipal waste combustor (MWC) units (Units 1 and 2) and associated support equipment. Each MWC unit has a nominal capacity of 288 tons of waste per day. Each furnace is equipped with an aqueous ammonia (NH 3 ) injection system based on the principle of selective non-catalytic reduction for nitrogen oxides (NO X ) control. After heat recovery for electricity production, the exhaust gas from each furnace is further cooled by injection of water and slaked lime slurry into a spray dryer absorber (scrubber) where acid gases react with lime and are converted to solid reaction products. Activated carbon is injected after the scrubber for mercury (Hg) and dioxin/furan (D/F) control. Fly ash, including reaction products from the scrubber and the spent activated carbon are removed in a fabric filter baghouse. The exhaust is conveyed via an induced-draft fan into a flue located within the facility stack.  Each MWC unit is equipped with continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) for NO X , sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), and carbon monoxide (CO), and a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS). Annual stack testing is required for particulate matter (PM), hydrogen chloride (HCl), Hg, D/F, cadmium and lead.  Steam output from the two processing trains drives a 15.7-megawatt steam turbine-electric generator. The fly ash, stoker grate bottom ash and other wastes are combined and transported to a Class I landfill or ash mono-fill having an in-place bottom liner and leachate collection system.  The facility also includes a storage silo for activated carbon and an emergency diesel-fueled fire pump engine, rated at 190 horsepower (HP).  This facility also includes miscellaneous unregulated/insignificant emissions units and/or activities.  Permitting Authority: Applications for Title V air operation permits are subject to review in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 403, Florida Statutes (F.S.) and Chapters 62-4, 62-210, and 62-213 of the Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.). The proposed project is not exempt from air permitting requirements and a Title V air operation permit is required to operate the facility.  The Permit Review Section in the Division of Air Resource Management is the Permitting Authority responsible for making a permit determination for these projects. The Permitting Authoritys physical address is: 2600 Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee, Florida. The Permitting Authoritys mailing address is: 2600 Blair Stone Road, MS #5505, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-2400. The Permitting Authoritys telephone number is 850/717-9000 and email address is DARM_Permitting@dep.state.fl.us.  Project File: A complete project file is available for public inspection during the normal business hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday (except legal holidays), at the address indicated above for the Permitting Authority. The complete project file includes the draft Title V air operation permit renewal, the statement of basis, the application, and the information submitted by the applicant, exclusive of confidential records under Section 403.111, F.S. Interested persons may view the permit by visiting the following website: https://fldep.dep.state.fl.us/air/emission/apds/default.asp and entering the permit number shown above. Interested persons may contact the Permitting Authoritys project review engineer for additional information at the address or phone number listed above.  Notice of Intent to Issue Air Permit: The Permitting Authority gives notice of its intent to issue a Title V air operation permit renewal to the applicant for the project described above. The applicant has provided reasonable assurance that operation of the proposed equipment will not adversely impact air quality and that the project will comply with all appropriate provisions of Chapters 62-4, 62-204, 62-210, 62-212, 62-213, 62-296 and 62-297, F.A.C. The Permitting Authority will issue a final permit in accordance with the conditions of the draft permit unless a response received in accordance with the following procedures results in a different decision or a significant change of terms or conditions.  Comments: The Permitting Authority will accept written comments concerning the draft Title V air operation permit renewal for a period of 30 days from the date of publication of the Public Notice. Written comments must be received by the close of business (5:00 p.m.), on or before the end of this 30-day period by the Permitting Authority at the above address. As part of his or her comments, any person may also request that the Permitting Authority hold a public meeting on this permitting action. If the Permitting Authority determines there is sufficient interest for a public meeting, it will publish notice of the time, date, and location in the Florida Administrative Register (FAR). If a public meeting is requested within the 30-day comment period and conducted by the Permitting Authority, any oral and written comments received during the public meeting will also be considered by the Permitting Authority. If timely received written comments or comments received at a public meeting result in a significant change to the draft permit, the Permitting Authority shall issue a revised draft permit and require, if applicable, another Public Notice. All comments filed will be made available for public inspection. For additional information, contact the Permitting Authority at the above address or phone number.  Petitions: A person whose substantial interests are affected by the proposed permitting decision may petition for an administrative hearing in accordance with Sections 120.569 and 120.57, F.S. Petitions filed by the applicant or any of the parties listed below must be filed within 14 days of receipt of this Written Notice of Intent to Issue Air Permit. Petitions filed by any persons other than those entitled to written notice under Section 120.60(3), F.S., must be filed within 14 days of publication of the attached Public Notice or within 14 days of receipt of this Written Notice of Intent to Issue Air Permit, whichever occurs first. Under Section 120.60(3), F.S., however, any person who asked the Permitting Authority for notice of agency action may file a petition within 14 days of receipt of that notice, regardless of the date of publication. A petitioner shall mail a copy of the petition to the applicant at the address indicated above, at the time of filing. A petition for administrative hearing must contain the information set forth below and must be filed (received) with the Agency Clerk in the Office of General Counsel, 3900 Commonwealth Boulevard, Mail Station # 35, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-3000, Agency_Clerk@dep.state.fl.us, before the deadline. The failure of any person to file a petition within the appropriate time period shall constitute a waiver of that persons right to request an administrative determination (hearing) under Sections 120.569 and 120.57, F.S., or to intervene in this proceeding and participate as a party to it. Any subsequent intervention (in a proceeding initiated by another party) will be only at the approval of the presiding officer upon the filing of a motion in compliance with Rule 28-106.205, F.A.C.  A petition that disputes the material facts on which the Permitting Authoritys action is based must contain the following information: (a) The name and address of each agency affected and each agencys file or identification number, if known; (b) The name, address, any email address, telephone number and any facsimile number of the petitioner; the name, address, any email address, telephone number, and any facsimile number of the petitioners representative, if any, which shall be the address for service purposes during the course of the proceeding; and an explanation of how the petitioners substantial interests will be affected by the agency determination; (c) A statement of when and how each petitioner received notice of the agency action or proposed decision; (d) A statement of all disputed issues of material fact. If there are none, the petition must so indicate; (e) A concise statement of the ultimate facts alleged, including the specific facts the petitioner contends warrant reversal or modification of the agencys proposed action; (f) A statement of the specific rules or statutes the petitioner contends require reversal or modification of the agencys proposed action including an explanation of how the alleged facts relate to the specific rules or statutes; and, (g) A statement of the relief sought by the petitioner, stating precisely the action the petitioner wishes the agency to take with respect to the agencys proposed action. A petition that does not dispute the material facts upon which the Permitting Authoritys action is based shall state that no such facts are in dispute and otherwise shall contain the same information as set forth above, as required by Rule 28-106.301, F.A.C.  Because the administrative hearing process is designed to formulate final agency action, the filing of a petition means that the Permitting Authoritys final action may be different from the position taken by it in this Written Notice of Intent to Issue Air Permit. Persons whose substantial interests will be affected by any such final decision of the Permitting Authority on the application have the right to petition to become a party to the proceeding, in accordance with the requirements set forth above.  Extension of Time: Under Rule 62-110.106(4), F.A.C., a person whose substantial interests are affected by the Departments action may also request an extension of time to file a petition for an administrative hearing. The Department may, for good cause shown, grant the request for an extension of time. Requests for extension of time must be filed with the Office of General Counsel of the Department at 3900 Commonwealth Boulevard, Mail Station 35, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-3000, or via electronic correspondence at Agency_Clerk@dep.state.fl.us, before the deadline for filing a petition for an administrative hearing. A timely request for extension of time shall toll the running of the time period for filing a petition until the request is acted upon.  Mediation: Mediation is not available in this proceeding.  Objections: Finally, pursuant to 42 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 7661d(b)(2), any person may petition the Administrator of the EPA within 60 days of the expiration of the Administrators 45-day review period as established at 42 U.S.C. Section 7661d(b)(1), to object to the issuance of any Title V air operation permit. Any petition shall be based only on objections to the permit that were raised with reasonable specificity during the 30-day public comment period provided in the Public Notice, unless the petitioner demonstrates to the Administrator of the EPA that it was impracticable to raise such objections within the comment period or unless the grounds for such objection arose after the comment period. Filing of a petition with the Administrator of the EPA does not stay the effective date of any permit properly issued pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 62-213, F.A.C. Petitions filed with the Administrator of EPA must meet the requirements of 42 U.S.C. Section 7661d(b)(2) and must be filed with the Administrator of the EPA at: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of the Administrator, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Mail Code: 1101A, Washington, DC 20460.

<div class="full-text-content">NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE PERMITThe Department of Environmental Protection gives notice of its intent to issue a permit to City of Orlando, Attn: Athena Tipaldos, 1010 Woods Ave, Orlando, FL 32805 to perform a restoration activity within Lake Orlando, a Class III waterbody. The project will conduct the lake restoration by treatment of liquid alum to reduce internal nutrient recycling and improve both the ecology and water quality of the lake. The liquid alum will be forming an inert precipitate with phosphorus, heavy metals, and organics, to prevent these compounds from being released into the water column.  The Department will issue the environmental resource permit and letter of consent to use sovereign submerged lands, unless a timely petition for an administrative proceeding is filed pursuant to the provisions of Sections 120.569 and 120.57, F.S.  The actual terms of the letter of consent will be formally executed at a later date and shall include provisions for rents and such other provisions as normally are included in such letter of consent. On the filing of a timely and sufficient petition, this action will not be final and effective until further order of the Department.  Because the administrative hearing process is designed to formulate final agency action, the hearing process may result in a modification of the agency action or even denial of the application.   The application file is available online and can be accessed through the Departments Information Portal at: https://prodenv.dep.state.fl.us/DepNexus/public/electronic-documents/ERP_464202/facility!search If you have any questions or are experiencing difficulty viewing the electronic application, please call the Department at (407) 897-4100.  A person whose substantial interests are affected by the Departments action may petition for an administrative proceeding (hearing) under Sections 120.569 and 120.57, F.S.  Pursuant to Rule 28-106.201, F.A.C., a petition for an administrative hearing must contain the following information:   (a) The name and address of each agency affected and each agencys file or identification number, if known;  (b) The name, address, any email address, any facsimile number, and telephone number of the petitioner; the name, address, and telephone number of the petitioners representative, if any, which shall be the address for service purposes during the course of the proceeding; and an explanation of how the petitioners substantial interests are or will be affected by the agency determination; (c) A statement of when and how the petitioner received notice of the agency decision; (d) A statement of all disputed issues of material fact.  If there are none, the petition must so indicate; (e) A concise statement of the ultimate facts alleged, including the specific facts that the petitioner contends warrant reversal or modification of the agencys proposed action; (f) A statement of the specific rules or statutes that the petitioner contends require reversal or modification of the agencys proposed action, including an explanation of how the alleged facts relate to the specific rules or statutes; and (g) A statement of the relief sought by the petitioner, stating precisely the action that the petitioner wishes the agency to take with respect to the agencys proposed action.   The petition must be filed (received by the Clerk) in the Office of General Counsel of the Department at 3900 Commonwealth Boulevard, Mail Station 35, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-3000.  Also, a copy of the petition shall be mailed to the applicant at the address indicated above at the time of filing.  In accordance with Rule 62-110.106(3), F.A.C., petitions for an administrative hearing by the applicant must be filed within 14 days of receipt of this written notice. Petitions filed by any persons other than the applicant, and other than those entitled to written notice under Section 120.60(3), F.S., must be filed within 14 days of publication of the notice or within  14 days of receipt of the written notice, whichever occurs first.  Under Section 120.60(3), F.S., however, any person who has asked the Department for notice of agency action may file a petition within 14 days of receipt of such notice, regardless of the date of publication.  The failure to file a petition within the appropriate time period shall constitute a waiver of that persons right to request an administrative determination (hearing) under Sections 120.569 and 120.57, F.S., or to intervene in this proceeding and participate as a party to it.  Any subsequent intervention (in a proceeding initiated by another party) will be only at the discretion of the presiding officer upon the filing of a motion in compliance with Rule 28-106.205, F.A.C.  Under Rule 62-110.106(4), F.A.C., a person whose substantial interests are affected by the Departments action may also request an extension of time to file a petition for an administrative hearing.  The Department may, for good cause shown, grant the request for an extension of time.  Requests for extension of time must be filed with the Office of General Counsel of the Department at 3900 Commonwealth Boulevard, Mail Station 35, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-3000, before the applicable deadline for filing a petition for an administrative hearing.  A timely request for extension of time shall toll the running of the time period for filing a petition until the request is acted upon.  Mediation is not available in this proceeding.  The applicant, or any party within the meaning of Section 373.114(1)(a) or 373.4275, F.S., may also seek appellate review of this order before the Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission under Section 373.114(1) or 373.4275, F.S.  Requests for review before the Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission and served on the Department within 20 days from the date when this order is filed with the Clerk of the Department.   10/31/2025 7890127</div>

As required by Sections 120.569 and 120.60(3), Fla. Stat., the following is notice of the opportunities which may be available for administrative hearing or judicial review when the substantial interests of a party are determined by an agency. Please note that this Notice of Rights is not intended to provide legal advice. Not all of the legal proceedings detailed below may be an applicable or appropriate remedy. You may wish to consult an attorney regarding your legal rights.


RIGHT TO REQUEST ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING
A person whose substantial interests are or may be affected by the South Florida Water Management Districts (SFWMD or District) action has the right to request an administrative hearing on that action pursuant to Sections 120.569 and 120.57, Fla.

Such requests for extension shall contain a certificate that the moving party has consulted with all other parties concerning the extension and that the SFWMD and any other parties agree to or oppose the extension. A timely request for an extension of time shall toll the running of the time period for filing a petition until the request is acted upon.

Filings by e-mail must be transmitted to the Office of the District Clerk at clerk@sfwmd.gov.

<div class="full-text-content">NOTICE OF INTENT TO ADOPT RULES   OF THE SOUTH FLORIDA WATER   MANAGEMENT DISTRICTRule 40E-2.091, F.A.C., and the incorporated Applicants Handbook for Water Use Permit Applications Within the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMDs Applicants Handbook)   SUMMARY: Chapter 2024-180, Laws of Florida (SB1386), which went into effect on July 1, 2024, requires water management districts to develop rules by December 31, 2025, to promote the use of reclaimed water and encourage quantifiable potable water offsets with specific requirements for such rules. The District is implementing SB1386 by proposing to amend Rule 40E-2.091, Florida Administrative Code, and the incorporated Applicants Handbook for Water Use Permit Applications, to add new subsection 1.5.1 E, to allow for consumptive use permit (CUP) durations up to 30 years and CUP extensions up to 10 years if a water supply development or water resource development project using reclaimed water meets certain conditions under the new subsection 373.250(9), F.S.   On October 9, 2025, the SFWMDs Governing Board adopted the proposed rule and authorized SFWMD staff to publish a Notice of Proposed Rule. Any affected person may request a public hearing on the rules within 21 days of the date the Notice of Proposed Rule is published in the Florida Administrative Register. If no request for a public hearing is timely received and no material changes are made to the proposed rules, the SFWMD will proceed with filing the proposed rules for adoption with the Department of State.   SUMMARY OF STATEMENT OF ESTIMATED REGULATORY COSTS AND LEGISLATIVE RATIFICATION:  The SFWMD has determined that the proposed rules will not have an adverse impact on small businesses and is not likely to increase, directly or indirectly, regulatory costs in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate within one year after the implementation of the rule. The District has not prepared a Statement of Estimated Regulatory Costs (SERC). The District has determined that the proposed rule is not expected to require legislative ratification.   A copy of the proposed Rule 40E-2.091, F.A.C., and the proposed SFWMDs Applicants Handbook for Water Use Permit Applications may be obtained on the Districts website at https://www.sfwmd.gov/doing-business-with-us/rules, and the Notice of Proposed Rule may be obtained on the Department of States website at http://www.flrules.org, where you may subscribe to receive copies of further notices for this or other rule chapters or types of notices of interest.

THE SOUTH FLORIDA WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT


Rule 40E-2</div>
<div class="notice-pub-date">Published: October 16, 2025</div>

<div id="full-text-11361810" class="notice-full-text" style="display: none;">
<div class="full-text-content">NOTICE OF INTENT TO ADOPT RULES OF
THE SOUTH FLORIDA WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT


Rule 40E-2.091, F.A.C., and the incorporated Applicants Handbook for Water Use Permit Applications Within the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMDs Applicants Handbook)

SUMMARY: Chapter 2024-180, Laws of Florida (SB1386), which went into effect on July 1, 2024, requires water management districts to develop rules by December 31, 2025, to promote the use of reclaimed water and encourage quantifiable potable water offsets with specific requirements for such rules. The District is implementing SB1386 by proposing to amend Rule 40E-2.091, Florida Administrative Code, and the incorporated Applicants Handbook for Water Use Permit Applications, to add new subsection 1.5.1 E, to allow for consumptive use permit (CUP) durations up to 30 years and CUP extensions up to 10 years if a water supply development or water resource development project using reclaimed water meets certain conditions under the new subsection 373.250(9), F.S.

On October 9, 2025, the SFWMDs Governing Board adopted the proposed rule and authorized SFWMD staff to publish a Notice of Proposed Rule. Any affected person may request a public hearing on the rules within 21 days of the date the Notice of Proposed Rule is published in the Florida Administrative Register. If no request for a public hearing is timely received and no material changes are made to the proposed rules, the SFWMD will proceed with filing the proposed rules for adoption with the Department of State. 

SUMMARY OF STATEMENT OF ESTIMATED REGULATORY COSTS AND LEGISLATIVE RATIFICATION:
The SFWMD has determined that the proposed rules will not have an adverse impact on small businesses and is not likely to increase, directly or indirectly, regulatory costs in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate within one year after the implementation of the rule. The District has not prepared a Statement of Estimated Regulatory Costs (SERC). The District has determined that the proposed rule is not expected to require legislative ratification.

A copy of the proposed Rule 40E-2.091, F.A.C., and the proposed SFWMDs Applicants Handbook for Water Use Permit Applications may be obtained on the Districts website at https://www.sfwmd.gov/doing-business-with-us/rules, and the Notice of Proposed Rule may be obtained on the Department of States website at http://www.flrules.org, where you may subscribe to receive copies of further notices for this or other rule chapters or types of notices of interest. For more information, contact: Simon Sunderland, Bureau Chief, Water Use - Regulation, ssunder@sfwmd.gov or (561) 682-2705.
