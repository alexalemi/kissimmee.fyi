All comments filed will be made available for public inspection.  Petitions: A person whose substantial interests are affected by the proposed permitting decision may petition for an administrative hearing in accordance with Sections 120.569 and 120.57, F.S. Petitions filed by any persons other than those entitled to written notice under Section 120.60(3), F.S., must be filed within 14 days of publication of the Public Notice or receipt of a written notice, whichever occurs first. Under Section 120.60(3), F.S., however, any person who asked the Permitting Authority for notice of agency action may file a petition within 14 days of receipt of that notice, regardless of the date of publication.

<div class="full-text-content">11/30/2025 PUBLIC NOTICE  SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMENT TO 2025-2026 ANNUAL ACTION PLAN  Notice is hereby given that, in accordance with 24 CFR 91.105(c)(2) of the federal regulations related to citizen participation in Community Planning and Development Programs, Orange County is making a substantial amendment to the 2025-2026 Annual Action Plan available to the public through this notice. This amendment is available for a 30-day public review and comment period from December 1, 2025, to December 30, 2025. Orange County receives federal funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) Program, and Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG). As a recipient of federal funds, the County is required to develop an Annual Action Plan that identifies specific activities that Orange County intends to pursue through the CDBG, HOME, ESG, and other state and local housing and community development programs, to address the objectives identified in the 2022-2026 Orange County Consolidated Plan. The FY 2025-2026 Annual Action Plan covers the period starting October 1, 2025, through September 30, 2026, and it was approved by the Board of County Commissioners on August 5, 2025. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) was created by the Housing Economic Recovery Act of 2008 to respond to the rising residential foreclosures and property abandonment, and to stabilize communities negatively impacted by foreclosures. Orange County received two allocations of NSP funds (NSP-1 and NSP-3) that were used for the following activities: 1) acquire, rehabilitate, and re-sell foreclosed homes to income- qualified buyers; 2) provide financial incentives to homebuyers of foreclosed homes; 3) acquire and rehabilitate foreclosed multifamily housing. The County is currently in the process of closing out both of the NSP programs, in accordance with HUD requirements and guidance. The Orange County Citizen Participation Plan, which was last updated in November of 2023, requires a substantial amendment to an approved Annual Action Plan when there is a change that adds a new activity. In accordance with requirements of the Citizen Participation Plan and 24 CFR Part 91.505, the County is proposing a substantial amendment to its FY 2025-2026 Annual Action Plan to transfer the program income from the NSP-3 Program, in the amount of $589,930.22, to the CDBG Program. The re-allocated funds will be expended on the CDBG-eligible activities to address the needs, priorities and goals identified in the 2022-2026 Orange County Consolidated Plan. The public will have the opportunity to review and comment on the proposed amendment to the 2025-2026 Annual Action Plan beginning Monday, December 1, 2025, through Tuesday, December 30, 2025. The draft amendment document will be available for review at Orange Countys website at the following link: http://www.ocfl.net/NeighborsHousing/CommunityDevelopment.aspx. All comments regarding these documents should be submitted during the public comment period identified above to: Janna Souvorova, Ph.D., AICP, Chief Planner Housing and Community Development Division 525 E. South Street, Orlando, FL 32801 Phone: (407) 836-0963 E-mail: Janna.Souvorova@ocfl.net  Section 286.0105, Florida Statutes, states that if a person decides to appeal any decision made by a board, agency, or commission with respect to any matter considered at a meeting or hearing, he or she will need a record of the proceedings, and that, for such purpose, he or she may need to ensure that a verbatim record of the proceedings is made, which record includes the testimony and evidence upon which the appeal is to be based.

<div class="full-text-content">ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT, SOUTH FLORIDA WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND SOUTHWEST FLORIDA WATER MANAGEMENT  DISTRICT GIVE NOTICE OF DISTRICT DECISION   The St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD), South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD), and Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) (collectively, the Districts) give notice of their decision approving the 2025 Central Florida Water Initiative Regional Water Supply Plan (CFWI RWSP), which was jointly developed by the Districts in coordination with stakeholders. The documents are further described below:  1. 2025 CFWI RWSP is available at https://aws.sjrwmd.com/CFWI/pdfs/CFWI-2025-RWSP-Draft-Final-Plan-Doc-10-3- 25.pdf 2. Appendices to 2025 CFWI RWSP is available at https://aws.sjrwmd.com/CFWI/pdfs/CFWI-2025-RWSP-Draft-Final-Appendices-10-3- 25.pdf  The 2025 CFWI RWSP was developed and approved to implement Section 373.709, Florida Statutes (F.S.). In the 2025 CFWI RWSP, the Districts have determined that existing sources of water are not adequate in all of Orange, Osceola, Polk, and Seminole Counties, and southern Lake County (CFWI Planning Area) to supply water for all existing and future reasonable- beneficial uses and to sustain the water resources and related natural systems through 2045. The CFWI Planning Area shall be considered a Water Resource Caution Area (WRCA) for the purposes of Section 403.064, F.S. The 2020 CFWI RWSP identifies alternative water supply (AWS) projects from which water suppliers may choose for meeting water supply needs within the designated WRCA. Although AWS projects added to the 2025 CFWI RWSP are potentially eligible for certain District funding, there is no assurance of funding.  The file(s) containing the 2025 CFWI RWSP are available for inspection Monday through Friday, except for legal holidays, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., at the following locations: St. Johns River Water Management District Headquarters, 4049 Reid St., Palatka, Florida, 32177-2529; South Florida Water Management District Headquarters, 3301 Gun Club Road, West Palm Beach, Florida 33406; Molly Brown, District Clerk, (561) 682-6805; and Southwest Florida Water Management District Headquarters, 2379 Broad Street, Brooksville, FL 34604.

You may also review these documents by using your web browser to go to https://cfwiwater.com.

<div id="full-text-11402193" class="notice-full-text" style="display: none;">
<div class="full-text-content">NOTICE OF INTENT TO ADOPT RULES OF THE SOUTH FLORIDA WATERMANAGEMENT DISTRICTThe South Florida Water Management District (District) is proposing to amend Rule 40E-1.607, F.A.C. as follows: 1) reduce the transfer fee for consumptive use permits (CUP) from $300 to $0; 2) add a CUP fee category for a 30-day backup supply for interrupted reclaimed water service, which will encourage the use of reclaimed water and reward those who currently use reclaimed water; and 3) add a CUP fee category to credit the processing fee for a CUP application that is withdrawn to a new application or notice received from the same applicant if done within 365 days from when the original application was withdrawn. The proposed amendments will reduce regulatory costs and will make the Districts CUP program consistent with its environmental resource permitting program.   On November 13, 2025, the Districts Governing Board authorized District staff to publish a Notice of Proposed Rule and adopt the proposed amendments to Rule 40E-1.607, F.A.C. Any affected person may request a public hearing on the rules within 21 days of the date the Notice of Proposed Rule is published in the Florida Administrative Register. If no request for a public hearing is timely received and no material changes are made to the proposed rules, the District will proceed with filing the proposed rules for adoption with the Department of State.   SUMMARY OF STATEMENT OF ESTIMATED REGULATORY COSTS AND LEGISLATIVE RATIFICATION:  The SFWMD has determined that the proposed rules will not have an adverse impact on small businesses and is not likely to increase, directly or indirectly, regulatory costs in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate within one year after the implementation of the rule. The District has not prepared a Statement of Estimated Regulatory Costs (SERC). The District has determined that the proposed rule is not expected to require legislative ratification.   A copy of the proposed Rule 40E-1.607, F.A.C., may be obtained on the Districts website at https://www.sfwmd.gov/doing-business-with-us/rules, and the Notice of Proposed Rule may be obtained on the Department of States website at http://www.flrules.org, where you may subscribe to receive copies of further notices for this or other rule chapters or types of notices of interest.

<div class="full-text-content">NOTICE OF INTENT TO ADOPT RULES OF
THE SOUTH FLORIDA WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT


The South Florida Water Management District (District) is proposing to amend Rule 40E-1.607, F.A.C. as follows: 1) reduce the transfer fee for consumptive use permits (CUP) from $300 to $0; 2) add a CUP fee category for a 30-day backup supply for interrupted reclaimed water service, which will encourage the use of reclaimed water and reward those who currently use reclaimed water; and 3) add a CUP fee category to credit the processing fee for a CUP application that is withdrawn to a new application or notice received from the same applicant if done within 365 days from when the original application was withdrawn. The proposed amendments will reduce regulatory costs and will make the Districts CUP program consistent with its environmental resource permitting program.


On November 13, 2025, the Districts Governing Board authorized District staff to publish a Notice of Proposed Rule and adopt the proposed amendments to Rule 40E-1.607, F.A.C. Any affected person may request a public hearing on the rules within 21 days of the date the Notice of Proposed Rule is published in the Florida Administrative Register. If no request for a public hearing is timely received and no material changes are made to the proposed rules, the District will proceed with filing the proposed rules for adoption with the Department of State.

SUMMARY OF STATEMENT OF ESTIMATED REGULATORY COSTS AND LEGISLATIVE RATIFICATION:
The SFWMD has determined that the proposed rules will not have an adverse impact on small businesses and is not likely to increase, directly or indirectly, regulatory costs in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate within one year after the implementation of the rule. The District has not prepared a Statement of Estimated Regulatory Costs (SERC). The District has determined that the proposed rule is not expected to require legislative ratification,

A copy of the proposed Rule 40E-1.607, F.A.C., may be obtained on the Districts website at https://www.sfwmd.gov/doing-business-with-us/rules, and the Notice of Proposed Rule may be obtained on the Department of States website at http://www.flrules.org, where you may subscribe to receive copies of further notices for this or other rule chapters or types of notices of interest. For more information, contact: Simon Sunderland, Bureau Chief, Water Use-Regulation, ssunderland@sfwmd.gov, or (561) 682-2705.
