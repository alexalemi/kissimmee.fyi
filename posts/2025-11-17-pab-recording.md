description: Making the recording publically available.
---

Usually, the Kissimmee PAB meetings recordings are made public very shortly after
the meetings. However, as of this writing, the Kissimmee PAB Meeting from
2025-11-05 has not had its recording uploaded. The recordings of the PAB
meetings are public records and subject to public records requests.

I put in a public records request for the meeting and wanted to ensure that it
is available broadly to anyone interested.  It was granted on 2025-11-17 as
Request Number: PRR2025-1645.
