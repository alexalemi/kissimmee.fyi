The City of Kissimmee provides an Advisory Board Member Handbook to newly appointed members of its advisory boards. It covers the structure of city government, the responsibilities of board members, Florida's Sunshine Law and Public Records Law, ethics requirements, and basic parliamentary procedures for meetings.

This is useful information not just for board members, but for any resident who wants to understand how these boards operate and how to participate in the process. The city told us they aren't able to easily make the document available online, so we're hosting a copy here.
