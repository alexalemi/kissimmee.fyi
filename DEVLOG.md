Bought the domain kissimmee.fyi and setup the DNS for github pages.  It'll serve out of the docs/ directory on the main branch.

I also figured out how to make api requests to the civicclerk portal to get meeting data and files, including downloading closed captions.

Used claude to try to analyze the transcripts of all of the PAB meetings I've attended so far.

Also figured out how to pull data out of the floridapublicnotices.com website.

Things I'd like to do:
 - Create an easier to navigate listing of the city meetings and calendar.
 - Give RSS feeds for all of the agenda and minutes for the meetings.
 - Make the city code easier to get at, expose something like a forwarding API or something.
 - Do the land tax analysis stuff and have some blog posts about it.
 - Pull all of the city announcements into one place.
 - Get all of the public notices as well.
